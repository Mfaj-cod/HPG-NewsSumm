Akhilesh Yadav announced a committee which will probe into the incident. \"We will investigate whether guidelines for managing the crowd was followed on the big day of Mauni Amavasya Snaan,\" said the state government in a statement. It also added that clear directions were given to local authorities that they should ensure that large number of people do not gather at one place. According to the initial reports, over two lakh people were present at the railway station when the stampede took place. Over three crore people gathered in Allahabad on Sunday to take a holy dip on the occasion of 'Mauni Amavasya' - considered the most auspicious day during the 12-yearly congregation. \"As per our estimates, three crore people have taken a holy dip till 3 pm. The influx of visitors has slowed down a bit since then but the turn-out has already exceeded our expectations,\" Kumbh Mela Officer Mani Prasad Mishra had said earlier in the day. Through the day devotees kept surging towards Sangam - the confluence of the holy rivers Ganga, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati - while the 13 'akharas' (sects) of sadhus took out their processions for the second 'Shahi Snan' (royal bath) during the Maha Kumbh. Amid chants of 'Har Har Gange', devotees including a fair sprinkling of foreigners, watched awestruck as 'naga sadhus' with their matted hair, ash-smeared naked bodies adorned with garlands of marigold and 'rudraksh' moved in processions with their 'Shri Mahants' and 'Mahamandaleshwars' (seers) perched atop decorated chariots, horses and elephants. A number of VIPs, including political heavyweights, film stars and business tycoons have visited the Kumbh over the past few weeks. However, the administration had banned any film promotional activity in the Kumbh area to prevent any situation which could lead to a stampede. The ritual of bathing started on Saturday afternoon itself when 'Mauni Amavasya' began according to the Hindu almanac and reached its crescendo on Sunday morning. A steady stream of devotees was seen at railway stations and bus stations where people from nearby as well as far-off places took to roads and pathways all of which seemed to be leading towards the Sangam on this day. A railway station in the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh was vandalised on Sunday morning by people angry over non-availability of a special train for a trip to the holy Sangam. Tight security arrangements were in place with more than 15,000 security personnel drawn from central paramilitary forces like ITBP, CRPF, BSF and RAF besides the Uttar Police and its Provincial Armed Constabulary and Anti-Terrorist Squad keeping a close vigil.

While the histories of their conflicts and the scale of violence have been very different, India has faced terror attacks all too often to not feel the pain in Israel where teenagers at a concert, children in a park, grandparents at home, and even babies in cribs were gunned down, amidst other atrocities Hamas carried out, including taking dozens hostage. The sentiments were repeated when Mr. Modi spoke to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, condemning terrorism in all its forms. India\u2019s second big concern has been the safety of its citizens, especially as Israel began retaliatory strikes on Gaza. Around 18,000 Indians work or study in Israel, in addition to about 85,000 Israelis of Indian origin (from Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Kerala, and West Bengal). The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has chartered flights to bring them home. New Delhi has also added nuance to the initial position, with the MEA delivering the government\u2019s first formal statement. While repeating the condemnation of the Hamas attacks, the statement reminded Israel about the \u201cuniversal obligation to observe international humanitarian law\u201d, as it carries out \u201cglobal responsibility to fight the menace of terrorism....\u201d In addition, the MEA reiterated its \u201clong-standing and consistent\u201d position on the Palestine issue. The statement is a reminder of the tightrope India has walked since 1992, when New Delhi established full diplomatic ties with Israel, while continuing to support the Palestinian cause. There has been a shift towards Israel\u2019s position, given increasingly close bilateral relations, trade, technological assistance, military procurement, and counter-terrorism cooperation. In 2017, Mr. Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel, while in 2018, Mr. Netanyahu visited India. However, Mr. Modi was also the first Indian Prime Minister to make an official visit to Palestine. In 2017, India voted against the U.S. and Israel for an attempt to declare unilaterally all of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital. The policy lines New Delhi is continuing to draw seem clear: to abhor terrorism, but not to condone indiscriminate reprisal bombings, even as it holds its consistent position on Palestine. No claim to righting historical grievances can possibly be used by Hamas to explain its inhuman attacks on Israel. However, a responsible state cannot behave like an insurgent group, and Israel\u2019s latest demand, that more than a million Gaza residents must evacuate as it continues to pound the city and plans a possible ground offensive, will make Delhi\u2019s challenge at balancing policy even more complex.\n\nSummary:\nIn response to the recent massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas fighters, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed solidarity with Israel and condemned terrorism in all its forms.

Sri Lanka is currently experiencing its worst economic crisis in history. With long lines for fuel, cooking gas, essentials in short supply and long hours of power cuts the public has been suffering for weeks. The Sri Lankan government has said it is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund while asking for fresh loans from India and China. A foreign exchange crunch in Sri Lanka has led to a shortage of essential goods such as fuel and cooking gas. Power cuts that last up to 13 hours a day.

    "prediction": "You are a professional news editor.\nWrite a concise, factual summary of the following news articles.\n\nArticles:\nMultiple forces have been pulling the Indian rupee down, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, the rising cost of international crude oil prices, and a strong dollar. Mint explains the implications of the decline in the Indian currency. How low can the rupee go? The rupee was falling till the middle of December 2021 over concerns about the economic fallout from the omicron wave, elevated crude oil prices, and expectations of quicker rate hikes by the US Fed. Subsequently, as covid cases declined, the currency showed signs of appreciation. The rupee came under pressure from late February in the wake of the war in Ukraine and the surge in crude oil prices. On 13 June, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar. Market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar going ahead, and touching 80 by the end of December. What is the impact on inflation? The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s April monetary policy report made the assumption that the rupee will trade around 76 per dollar during FY23, adding that a 5% decline from this would raise inflation by 20 basis points. The rupee has already declined 2% from this assumption, signalling a worsening of inflation ahead. RBI said that given the high volatility in financial and commodity markets, the pass-through of currency weakness to inflation will not be linear and will vary with time. India\u2019s inflation was earlier expected to moderate this year due to RBI\u2019s measures, but the eroding rupee will deny this benefit. What does a weaker rupee mean for businesses? One, higher import costs. Second, Indian firms have been borrowing from the offshore dollar market, and the stock of commercial borrowing stood at $226.4 billion at the end of December 2021. Interest repayments are, therefore, expected to swell. Fund-raising through external commercial borrowing is likely to moderate too. Will current account deficit worsen? Current account deficit (CAD), or when the imports are more than exports, is expected to worsen. For a net importer like India, a weak currency isn\u2019t good news. This worsens CAD especially at a time of heavy FPI outflows. The CAD could touch 3% of GDP (vs CAD of 1.2% in April-Dec 2021) due to higher import bills and a fall in forex reserves, since it is being used to finance the deficit. Forex reserves stood at $596.45 billion as on 10 June. However, over the next year, reserves could rise if exporters benefit from the cost advantage. What are the options before RBI? India\u2019s central bank has been selling dollars from its reserves and buying rupee, which leads to the supply of dollar going up and that of the rupee falling. At the beginning of October, one dollar was worth a little over \u20b974 and it is currently around \u20b978. If RBI hadn\u2019t intervened, dollar could have touched \u20b980 already. That said, RBI cannot keep selling dollars as its forex reserves will deplete at a faster pace. Since October last year, India\u2019s forex reserves have fallen by around $40 billion.\n\nSummary:\nThe Indian rupee has been declining due to factors such as the exit of foreign portfolio investors, rising crude oil prices, and a strong US dollar. The rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, 2022, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar going forward, potentially reaching 80 by the end of the year.

    "reference": "The Indian rupee has been declining due to several factors, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, rising international crude oil prices, and a strong US dollar. As a result, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar, possibly reaching 80 by the end of December. The impact on inflation is significant, as a weaker rupee is expected to worsen inflation. The Reserve Bank of India assumed that the rupee would trade around 76 per dollar during FY23 and noted that a 5% decline from this level would raise inflation by 20 basis points. For businesses, a weaker rupee means higher import costs, and Indian firms that have borrowed from the offshore dollar market will face increased interest repayments. The current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to worsen due to the weak rupee, especially at a time of heavy foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows. The CAD could reach 3% of GDP, compared to 1.2% in April-December 2021. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been intervening by selling dollars from its reserves to support the rupee. However, this approach has its limits, as depleting forex reserves at a rapid pace is not sustainable. RBI will need to carefully manage its interventions to stabilize the rupee without depleting its reserves too quickly."

Now, India\u2019s federal think tank Niti Aayog has joined the debate, recommending social security policies for such workers. Mint explains. hat is Niti Aayog\u2019s recommendation? The think tank has recommended that platforms or startups provide gig workers with more support in the form of pension, provident fund, paid sick leave, and medical and life insurance. It has also recommended creating a social security fund to account for injuries and emergencies. It has also suggested the government create \u2018platform initiatives\u2019\u2014along the lines of Startup India\u2014 which will carry out a census of gig workers to survey and identify them. It wants this framework to upskill them and help them access loans with generous timelines in case of an emergency, and open credit lines for their own ventures. Why are these proposals important? The gig economy is expected to triple in size to 23.5 million workers by 2030, according to Niti Aayog\u2019s estimates. The gig economy, therefore, can potentially alleviate unemployment, and provide opportunities to women and marginalized workers. The federal think tank also feels that the platform economy can lead to greater formalization of work. Nevertheless, there are concerns. The think tank noted that long hours and low earnings could result in exploitative work practices. The recommendations come at a time when gig workers at several platforms have protested against harsh work conditions. How are gig workers treated in other countries? Last year, the UK Supreme Court said Uber drivers are entitled to minimum wages and holiday pay. In 2020, the US Congress extended unemployment insurance to gig workers as part of covid relief steps. The US government has recommended classifying some gig workers as \u2018employees\u2019. Recently, a Swiss court ruled that Uber drivers were employees. Do startups provide any support today? Most startups provide medical, accidental or life insurance policies, but not provident fund or pension benefits. Some companies offer on-job training and benefits such as loans or scholarships for workers\u2019 children. In some cases, a loyal gig worker, one who has spent years on a platform, may be absorbed as a permanent employee. But that\u2019s rare.

Unfortunately, this conflict has already resulted in a tragic toll, with around 1,500 civilian casualties and the destruction of some 7,000 housing units, as reported by Palestinian authorities. Given the gravity of the situation, Israel has ramped up its efforts to help civilians in Gaza. They've been air-dropping leaflets and establishing safe routes, open between 10 am and 4 pm local time, to assist over a million people in Gaza. This evacuation process has seen many civilians heading toward Egypt, causing concern for Egyptian authorities, who are now taking measures to control the influx of refugees at their border. Diplomatic efforts involving key international players like the United States, Saudi Arabia, and China are underway, with the goal of finding a peaceful solution. With Israel reportedly mobilizing around 350,000 soldiers for a full-scale land invasion, there is growing concern about the potential increase in casualties on both sides, especially in urban areas. The United States Parliament has deemed this conflict a top priority, emphasizing the urgent need for international attention and mediation to minimize further human suffering."

    "prediction": "You are a professional news editor.\nWrite a concise, factual summary of the following news articles.\n\nArticles:\nA prominent Indo-Canadian community member has voiced deep concern over the \"ecosystem\" in Canada that has enabled Khalistan extremists to use violence, threaten and bully those opposing their \"nefarious agendas''. Amidst the diplomatic standoff between Canada and India over the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist in Surrey in British Columbia province in June, he cautioned that political appeasement for short-term gains is not in the interest of Canada's future. \"Freedom of expression should be for everyone. We have unfortunately created that kind of ecosystem in Canada where these people are very vocal, very violent, very aggressive, and they don't let anybody.... come out against them. They will bully, they will threaten, they will use every possible illegal means... to counter any sanity,\" he said, adding that Sikhs across the US, Canada and the UK have come out and said that they don't believe or endorse the Khalistan ideology. \"These (are big issues) that worry us as Canadians, in the long-term interest of Canada. We feel worried about the future of our children, about the rifts between communities,\" he said, adding that leaders in government and officials in policy and advocacy should take up those issues for the larger interest of Canada. India and Canada are embroiled in a diplomatic standoff following allegations by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Canadian Parliament last month that \"Canadian security agencies have been actively pursuing credible allegations of a potential link between agents of the government of India and the killing\" of Khalistani extremist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil on June 18 in British Columbia, a charge angrily rejected by New Delhi as \"absurd\" and \"motivated\". Malik referred to the bombing of Air India Flight 182 in 1985 and said people and families of victims to date feel they have not got justice. The Montreal-Delhi Air India 'Kanishka' Flight 182 exploded 45 minutes before it was to have landed at London's Heathrow Airport on June 23, 1985, killing all 329 people on board, most of them Canadians of Indian descent. The bombing was blamed on Sikh militants in retaliation to the 'Operation Blue Star' to flush out militants from the Golden Temple in 1984. \"As a Canadian, I have no hesitation in admitting that we haven't been able to call out the ideology and people who were responsible for that. We've seen them flourish. We've seen them grow, that ideology has grown, got beyond control. People have suffered. Within (the) Sikh community also, there are people who've suffered because of this ideology. They have not got justice for over 40 years now,\" he said. \"This ideology has been flourishing and growing, with whatever patronage or whatever support. That is not Sikh ideology. That is not what Sikh people believe in,\" he said. He questioned what prompted Prime Minister Trudeau to conclude within four months in Nijjar's case and noted that there are diplomatic ways for countries to deal with issues behind closed doors. \"It looks to us, as Canadians, it's more like appeasement politics or a political move than anything else,\" he said, adding that the issue should have been dealt with in a different way to ensure the already strained relationship between the two countries due to the matters left unresolved for decades now, is not further spoilt. Malik added that Canada has been facing challenges, including economic recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic and cost of living. \"We need countries like India, partners like India,\" whose economies are growing, he said. \"It is in our interest as Canada, and as Canadians, to work closely with countries like India, and if there are issues, they need to be resolved in a way that it does not hamper Canadians' chances to get economic benefit from opportunities which India presents today,\" he added. \"Both these countries have a great future. People on both sides are very progressive. They want the relationship to flourish, they want exchanges to take place, students to come here, people come here to set up businesses, people to go (to India) to explore opportunities,\" he said. He added that it is important to resolve the issues, not let them escalate and to \"nip them in the bud\".\n\nSummary:\nA prominent Indo-Canadian community member has expressed concern over the \"ecosystem\" in Canada that has enabled Khalistan extremists to use violence, threaten, and bully those opposing their \"nefarious agendas.\" Amidst the diplomatic standoff between Canada and India over the killing of a pro-Khalistan separatist in Surrey in British Columbia province in June, he cautioned that political appeasement for short-term gains is not in the interest of Canada's future.

With the Lander accomplishing a \u2018soft landing\u2019 on the Moon\u2019s south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so. A rover, which is a small vehicle that is meant to move around on the Moon\u2019s surface, then came out of the Lander. On August 24, ISRO released a video of how this happened on X. When Chandrayaan-3 took off for the Moon on July 14, we explained the basics of the mission \u2013 how a mission launches into Space, what the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions were, etc. You can click here to read it. Here, we further explain why a \u2018soft landing\u2019 was crucial to the mission, what makes landing on the south pole a difficult feat, and what is to happen after the landing. What is a soft landing, and why did Chandrayaan-3 land on the south pole? According to ISRO, the mission\u2019s three objectives were to demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, to demonstrate a Rover roving on the Moon and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments. Soft landing simply means landing at a gentle, controlled speed to not sustain damage to a spacecraft. Amitabha Ghosh, a scientist for NASA\u2019s Rover mission to Mars, explained it in The Indian Express thus: \u201cImagine a spacecraft hurtling through space, at 10 times the speed of an airplane, having to nearly come to a standstill in order to land gently on the Earth \u2014 all in a matter of a few minutes and, more importantly, without any human intervention. This, in a nutshell, is a soft landing.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nIndia's Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully landed on the Moon's south pole at 6:04 pm on August 23, making India the only country to achieve this feat. A rover was deployed after the Lander completed a 'soft landing'. The mission's objectives were to demonstrate a safe landing, a rover's capability to traverse the lunar surface, and conduct in-situ scientific experiments. A soft landing refers to a gentle, controlled descent to prevent damage to the spacecraft. Landing on the Moon's south pole was particularly challenging due to its rugged terrain. Following the landing, the rover will begin its exploration of the lunar",
    "reference": "The Chandrayaan-3 Lander carried more fuel than Chandrayaan-2. This was done to ensure that the Lander is able to make a last-minute change in its landing site if it needs to. The Chandrayaan-3 Lander has solar panels on four sides, instead of only two in Chandrayaan-2. This was to ensure that the Lander continued to draw solar power, even if it landed in a wrong direction, or tumbled over. At least one or two of its sides would always be facing the Sun, and remain active."

Breast cancer is one of the biggest killers in several countries. With nearly 100,000 new cases reported every year in India, it has overtaken cervical cancer as the number one cancer afflicting women. The results published online in the journal Nature Medicine (\u201cAn autoimmune-mediated strategy for prophylactic breast cancer vaccination,\u201d by Ritika Jaini et al , of Cleveland Clinic, Ohio) show that none of the genetically breast cancer-prone mice vaccinated with a single dose of alpha-lactalbumin protein developed the cancer while those that received a placebo did. Except for a couple of studies, research has shown the significance of using this protein as a potential antigen for breast cancer. Alpha-lactalbumin is normally not present in non-breast human tissues. Hence to be chosen as a preventive vaccine candidate antigen to prime the immune system, the protein should satisfy certain conditions. It should be expressed by a majority of breast tumours at significant levels that allow its detection. Secondly, its production by normal breast cells should be restricted to certain easily traceable situations. In this case, alpha-lactalbumin, a lactation-dependent milk protein, is expressed only by lactating mothers. Also, there appears to be less likelihood of the prophylactic vaccine causing any harm to vaccinated women because, the authors note, the availability of the protein is \u201cinsufficient in normal non-lactating tissue.\u201d\n\nSummary:\nA vaccine trial for preventing breast cancer in mice has shown promising results, raising hopes for its potential use in humans.

The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that mice genetically prone to breast cancer, when vaccinated with alpha-lactalbumin protein, didn't develop the cancer, unlike those given a placebo. The protein, not found in non-breast tissues, meets essential criteria for a preventive vaccine candidate. It's primarily present in lactating mothers, making it unlikely to harm non-lactating women. This development is a significant step in the quest for an effective breast cancer vaccine."

The Plumpang fuel storage station, operated by state-run oil and gas company Pertamina, is near a densely populated area in the Tanah Merah neighborhood in North Jakarta. It supplies 25% of Indonesia's fuel needs. At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines were struggling to contain the blaze in the nearby neighborhood, fire officials said. Video of the fire broadcast on television showed hundreds of people in the community running in panic while thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky and firefighters battled the blaze. A preliminary investigation showed the fire broke out when a pipeline ruptured during heavy rain, possibly from a lightning strike, said Eko Kristiawan, Pertamina's area manager. He said the fire would not disrupt the country's fuel supply. Satriadi Gunawan, who heads Jakarta's fire and rescue department, said people living in the residential area were still being evacuated and were being taken to a nearby village hall and a mosque. \"The fire caused several explosions and quickly spread to residential houses,\" Gunawan said. He said at least 17 people were dead, including two children, and 50 had been hospitalized, some with severe burns. Indonesia's minister of state-owned enterprises, Erick Thohir, expressed his condolences to the victims and their families and ordered Pertamina to thoroughly investigate the fire and focus on quickly assisting the community. \"There must be an operational evaluation in the future. I'll continue to monitor this case,\" Thohir said in a video statement. Friday's fire was the second large blaze at the Plumpang fuel depot. In 2014, a fire engulfed at least 40 nearby houses but no casualties were reported. Fahmi Radhi, an energy analyst, urged Pertamina and the government to immediately move the depot away from the nearby community settlements. \"Pertamina has been negligent by not using international standard security systems,\" he said in an interview with KOMPAS TV. He said that since the 2014 fire there had been no efforts to put such a system in place and that regular inspections should be conducted to avoid future fires. \"Pertamina's board of directors should be held responsible for this deadly fire by being dismissed immediately,\" Radhi said. An oil spill in 2018 caused a fire that killed five people and sickened hundreds in the port city of Balikpapan.

This has led to the politicization of various academic matters, such as the appointment of teachers, principals, and revision of courses. The Delhi University Teachers' Associations, which are politically affiliated, have influenced these decisions. This has resulted in poor quality of teaching, as the appointment of teachers is often influenced by political groups. The lack of regular meetings of the academic council has also hindered the raising of issues. However, there have been instances where groups have been divided over student interest issues. The direct impact of politics is felt",
    "reference": "In Delhi University, students often find themselves caught in the political crossfire, where teachers, affiliated with various political groups, have moved beyond academics into the realm of politics. The influence of political groups within the academic council is noticeable, affecting matters like teacher appointments and course revisions. The impact of this political interference can be seen in the quality of teaching and frequent strikes that leave classrooms empty. While some groups may claim to act in students' interests, the situation remains complex, with ideological divisions even affecting course upgrades. However, some argue that teachers should focus on active participation in academic activities, like university-industry interaction cells, to improve the educational landscape."

Ram Niwas Sehrawat, a farmer from Bawana, led a 40-day protest to secure fair compensation.

Farmers are also concerned about the government's land acquisition process, where they often lose their crops to field leveling. While some see the compensation as adequate, others suggest financial management training to ensure wise investments. Opinions on the government's position vary among farmers."

(george fernandes is convenor, nda. he spoke to mahendra ved)\n\nSummary:\nThe article discusses the role of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the leader of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in India. The author, George Fernandes, who is the convenor of the NDA, highlights Vajpayee's experience, statesmanship, and the fact that his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has the largest membership in the alliance. Fernandes also mentions Vajpayee's initiatives, such as the Agra summit with Pakistan, which he believes would not have been possible without Vajpayee's leadership. Fernandes argues that Vajpayee",
    "reference": "As long as the NDA exists and Atal Bihari Vajpayee remains active and in good health, he will continue to lead it. Vajpayee has been the unifying force for two crucial reasons: his experience and statesmanship, and the fact that he leads the largest party in the NDA, which has more members than all other NDA partners combined. During his three years as the country's leader, Vajpayee has demonstrated his capabilities and taken initiatives that have made him virtually irreplaceable. A significant milestone was his effort to initiate a dialogue with Pakistan, notably through the Agra summit, which paved the way for future discussions on a range of issues. His leadership and rapport with NDA components make him indispensable, akin to a father figure. He can withstand challenges and is known for being a good listener, which fosters trust among NDA members. It is incorrect to claim that he was imposed from the top or has failed to address differences within the NDA. The political landscape has evolved, and lessons have been learned from past experiments in forming non-Congress governments. The NDA was created with a national agenda for governance, transcending ideological differences and sectoral interests. Despite occasional dissent, the NDA government is expected to complete its full term. (George Fernandes is the convenor of the NDA, and he shared these insights in an interview with Mahendra Ved.)"

Reason? IIM-B is registered under the Mysore Societies Registered under the Mysore Societies Registration Act XVII of 1960 An amendment in its memorandum can be done only by a general body meeting, which will then have to be approved by the Centre and the respective state government. ..The Centre and the state govt are members of the IIM-B Society. The Karnataka government had granted 100 acres of land for the IIM-B campus on Bannerghatta Road. Three officials representing various departments of the state government are members of the IIM-B Society. The Bangalore University V-C is also a member of the general body. As per the existing rules, the IIM-B Board of Governors with the approval of the Centre has to submit a proposition to amend the MoA in a written/ printed form and convene a special general body meeting for the purpose.

Following an order passed last month by the Delhi high court to review its decision on the Kashmir-link project, the board asked the counsel for Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), Prashant Bhushan, to present his viewpoint to it on January 19. The board has been forced to hold this special meeting with Bhushan even after he had, in a letter dated January 8, accused two of its members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of suppressing the safety risks inherent in the \u201cslope skirting alignment\u201d advocated by them. In his PIL, Bhushan also pointed out that Chopra, member engineering, had undone the corrective action initiated by his predecessor S K Vij in 2008 of scrapping the much-touted plan to build the world\u2019s tallest arch bridge on Chenab and thereby paving the way for adopting a straighter and shorter alignment based on the modern technology of tunneling through mountains. Vij\u2019s corrective action was based on the proposal of switching from the slope-skirting alignment to a straighter and shorter alignment as the latter was designed to reduce exposure of the railway line to land-slides in the geologically fragile Himalayan mountains from Katra to Banihal in the Jammu region. Since the focus of the PIL is on the deficiencies of its August decision to retain the slope-skirting alignment, the board will be hard pressed to justify its failure to implement the assurance given by railway minister Mamata Banerjee in her Budget speech two months earlier that the \u201cforemost concern\u201d of the review of the Kashmir-link project would be \u201cthe safety of the passengers\u201d. The PIL has accused the board of working against the interests of the nation by overlooking the \u201cfundamental flaws in the alignment\u201d which prevented the project from progressing more than 10% in seven years. Though the project was due to be completed in 2007, all that has been opened so far is the section in the flat terrain of the Kashmir valley while making little headway in dealing the engineering challenge of crossing the Himalayan barrier. According to the PIL, Chopra went out of his way to persuade the board to retain the flawed alignment because he had been involved in its planning and execution in the crucial first four years of the project.\n\nSummary:\nThe Railway Board in India has invited a petitioner from the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) named Prashant Bhushan to present his viewpoint on the safety risks associated with the Kashmir-link project, which aims to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of the country. This decision comes after the Delhi High Court ordered a review of the Railway Board's August decision to retain the slope-skirting alignment for the project. Bhushan had previously accused two members of the Railway Board, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of suppressing safety risks related to the alignment. In his PIL, Bhushan also criticized",
    "reference": "The Railway Board has found itself compelled to address safety concerns regarding the Kashmir valley connectivity project due to judicial intervention and a Public Interest Litigation (PIL). A Delhi High Court order prompted the board to invite the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan from the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), to present his safety-related viewpoints on the project. Bhushan had previously accused two board members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of concealing safety risks associated with their preferred \"slope skirting alignment.\" Bhushan's PIL emphasized the need for a straighter, shorter alignment to mitigate landslide risks in the Himalayan terrain, as initially proposed by S.K. Vij in 2008 but later reversed by Chopra. The PIL criticized the board for failing to address fundamental alignment issues, causing significant delays in the project's completion. The Railway Board now faces scrutiny over its decision to retain the contentious alignment, despite earlier assurances regarding passenger safety made by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee. The PIL argues that the board's actions have hindered the project's progress, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2007. While a portion of the project in the Kashmir valley has been completed, challenges associated with crossing the Himalayan terrain remain largely unresolved. The PIL contends that Chopra's involvement in the project's planning and execution during its initial stages influenced the board's decision to maintain the problematic alignment. The board must address these concerns in response to judicial directives."
