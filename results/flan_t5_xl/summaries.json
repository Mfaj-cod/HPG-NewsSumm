    "reference": "The Indian rupee has been declining due to several factors, including the exit of foreign portfolio investors, rising international crude oil prices, and a strong US dollar. As a result, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar, possibly reaching 80 by the end of December. The impact on inflation is significant, as a weaker rupee is expected to worsen inflation. The Reserve Bank of India assumed that the rupee would trade around 76 per dollar during FY23 and noted that a 5% decline from this level would raise inflation by 20 basis points. For businesses, a weaker rupee means higher import costs, and Indian firms that have borrowed from the offshore dollar market will face increased interest repayments. The current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to worsen due to the weak rupee, especially at a time of heavy foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows. The CAD could reach 3% of GDP, compared to 1.2% in April-December 2021. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been intervening by selling dollars from its reserves to support the rupee. However, this approach has its limits, as depleting forex reserves at a rapid pace is not sustainable. RBI will need to carefully manage its interventions to stabilize the rupee without depleting its reserves too quickly."

    "reference": "Promising results from a mouse trial for a breast cancer vaccine have raised hopes for human use. Breast cancer is a major health concern, particularly in India. The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that mice genetically prone to breast cancer, when vaccinated with alpha-lactalbumin protein, didn't develop the cancer, unlike those given a placebo. The protein, not found in non-breast tissues, meets essential criteria for a preventive vaccine candidate. It's primarily present in lactating mothers, making it unlikely to harm non-lactating women. This development is a significant step in the quest for an effective breast cancer vaccine."

The committee pointed out that high courts had broader powers under Article 226 compared to the Supreme Court, which was limited to safeguarding fundamental rights.

One might have anticipated a continuation of this fiscal restraint, even though it was primarily achieved by curbing capital spending rather than reducing subsidies. However, in the latest budget presentation, the finance minister signaled an intention to increase public spending at a rate faster than the expected nominal economic growth.

Vajpayee has been the unifying force for two crucial reasons: his experience and statesmanship, and the fact that he leads the largest party in the NDA, which has more members than all other NDA partners combined. During his three years as the country's leader, Vajpayee has demonstrated his capabilities and taken initiatives that have made him virtually irreplaceable. A significant milestone was his effort to initiate a dialogue with Pakistan, notably through the Agra summit, which paved the way for future discussions on a range of issues. His leadership and rapport with NDA components make him indispensable, akin to a father figure. He can withstand challenges and is known for being a good listener, which fosters trust among NDA members. It is incorrect to claim that he was imposed from the top or has failed to address differences within the NDA. The political landscape has evolved, and lessons have been learned from past experiments in forming non-Congress governments. The NDA was created with a national agenda for governance, transcending ideological differences and sectoral interests. Despite occasional dissent, the NDA government is expected to complete its full term. (George Fernandes is the convenor of the NDA, and he shared these insights in an interview with Mahendra Ved.)"

A Delhi High Court order prompted the board to invite the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan from the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), to present his safety-related viewpoints on the project. Bhushan had previously accused two board members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of concealing safety risks associated with their preferred \"slope skirting alignment.\" Bhushan's PIL emphasized the need for a straighter, shorter alignment to mitigate landslide risks in the Himalayan terrain, as initially proposed by S.K. Vij in 2008 but later reversed by Chopra. The PIL criticized the board for failing to address fundamental alignment issues, causing significant delays in the project's completion. The Railway Board now faces scrutiny over its decision to retain the contentious alignment, despite earlier assurances regarding passenger safety made by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee. The PIL argues that the board's actions have hindered the project's progress, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2007. While a portion of the project in the Kashmir valley has been completed, challenges associated with crossing the Himalayan terrain remain largely unresolved. The PIL contends that Chopra's involvement in the project's planning and execution during its initial stages influenced the board's decision to maintain the problematic alignment. The board must address these concerns in response to judicial directives."

    "reference": "The Election Commission (EC) has reduced the disqualification period for Sikkim Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang from electoral contest, a move that could potentially reverse the trend towards decriminalising politics. Tamang was convicted under the Prevention of Corruption Act for misappropriating \u20b99.50 lakh in the purchase of milch cows in 1996-97. His one-year prison term was upheld by the High Court and Supreme Court. He was later appointed Chief Minister by the Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM) and challenged his appointment in the Supreme Court. Tamang argued that the law prevailing at the time of his offence entailed disqualification only if the sentence was for a term of two years or more. The EC's decision goes against legislative and judicial measures to strengthen the legal framework against corruption, and it is likely to strain its credibility."

Debt and Confidence: Access to credit can boost financial confidence, but over-reliance on loans can become problematic, especially if salary hikes or bonuses don't materialize as expected. This confidence tends to fade as people enter their 30s. Balancing Expenses: Financial planners recommend the 30:30:40 rule, which allocates 30% of income to expenses, 30% to EMIs (loan repayments), and 40% into savings. The article provides practical advice for millennials to manage their finances and secure their future while enjoying the present."

    "prediction": "Operation Twist is a move in which a central bank decides to simultaneously buy long-dated securities while selling short-term securities. The objective of such an operation is management of the yield curve. This is the first time RBI has undertaken such an unconventional policy measure with the aim of flattening the yield curve by lowering longer rates to boost lending and growth. On Monday, RBI undertook its second round of open market operations (OMOs), the first round of which was undertaken on 23 October.",
    "reference": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently implemented its version of Operation Twist, which involves buying long-dated securities while selling short-term securities. Here's an overview of this move and its impact on government security (G-Sec) yields: Importance of Operation Twist: Operation Twist is a central bank's strategy to manage the yield curve by buying long-term securities and selling short-term ones. The primary goal is to influence interest rates at different maturities. Other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, have used similar measures. This was the first time the RBI adopted this unconventional policy measure to flatten the yield curve by reducing longer-term rates, aiming to boost lending and economic growth. RBI's Transaction Details: The RBI's recent move involved buying \u20b910,000 crore worth of 10-year bonds while selling \u20b98,501 crore of one-year bonds on December 30th. This approach was intended to reduce term premia, affecting different bond maturities. Impact on Bond Yields: The recent Operation Twist had a noticeable impact on bond yields, which had risen to 6.705% on December 18. After the move was announced on December 19, 2019, yields dropped to 6.501% on January 1, 2020. The stabilization of bond yields was attributed to ending uncertainty about fiscal deficit figures and establishing a credible long-term fiscal consolidation plan. Yield Curve Management Signals: While RBI had previously ruled out direct involvement in yield curve management, the Operation Twist signaled a potential shift in its stance. However, the second round of Operation Twist on December 30th didn't have as much effect on yields due to investor concerns about the fiscal deficit for the fiscal year 2019-20. RBI's announcement of state borrowings worth \u20b92 trillion for Q4 FY20 also played a role in shaping market sentiment. Expectation of More Operations: In light of the need to improve monetary transmission, more operations like Operation Twist are expected in the future. The RBI aims to enhance transmission while maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance. A counter-cyclical fiscal policy is seen as necessary due to economic growth slowdown, and by addressing deficit targets and establishing a credible medium-term consolidation plan, the government can send positive signals to bond markets, complementing the RBI's Operation Twist efforts. Operation Twist is a tool used by central banks to influence the yield curve and interest rates to stimulate economic activity and lending."

    "reference": "Automated Facial Recognition Software (AFRS) has become an integral part of policing, with the potential to serve various purposes. Here are the key points regarding AFRS: Purpose of AFRS: AFRS is software designed to recognize, record, and match faces from photos and videos against government databases. Its purposes include finding missing children captured on CCTV, tracking criminals across a country, and identifying individuals based on previous protests or events, such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Delhi. How AFRS Works: AFRS used by law enforcement differs from facial recognition systems on smartphones. It measures facial features to create a template for matching faces. This technology can work in various lighting conditions, detect makeup, plastic surgery, aging, and even sketches of subjects. Effectiveness and Limitations: While AFRS technology is being adopted globally by law enforcement agencies, its accuracy can vary. An academic review of London's Metropolitan Police's facial recognition system found errors in 81% of cases, highlighting its limitations. Access to Databases: AFRS has access to various databases, including criminal, passport, Aadhaar (which includes photos), Immigration, Visa, Foreigners' Registration Tracking, Khoya-Paya (a child tracking system), and the National Automated Fingerprint Identification System. The more data available, the more accurate the system's output. Scope in India: India's AFRS initiative aims for a centralized web application hosted at the National Crime Records Bureau's data center in Delhi. It will be made available to all police stations in the country, demonstrating its national scale. The software is also expected to work on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows, with the provision of mobile data terminals to police stations. AFRS technology has the potential to assist law enforcement in various aspects but also raises concerns regarding privacy, accuracy, and ethical use."

However, the fiscal deficit for the period April-November is higher than this and stands at 8.08 trillion. Mint takes a look at the options before the government to reduce the fiscal deficit.",
    "reference": "India's fiscal deficit for the period of April to November has surpassed the budgeted amount, standing at \u20b98.08 trillion, which is nearly 15% higher than the budgeted fiscal deficit for the entire fiscal year. The fiscal deficit is affected by both total government expenditures and earnings, and while expenditures are within expectations, the issue lies with tax revenues. Tax collections have remained largely flat this fiscal year, with gross tax revenue growing only 0.8% compared to the same period in the previous year. However, the government had anticipated an 18.3% growth in gross tax revenue to meet its budgeted projections. The gap between actual revenue and budgeted revenue poses a significant challenge for the government in terms of meeting its fiscal deficit targets for the year. The government's target for gross tax revenue for the fiscal year is \u20b924.61 trillion, and it has only collected around 48% of this amount during the first eight months. The government is unlikely to bridge this revenue gap by the end of the fiscal year, making it difficult to meet its fiscal deficit goals. One potential solution for reducing the fiscal deficit is disinvestment, which was expected to bring in \u20b91.05 trillion this fiscal year. However, disinvestment progress has been slow, with only 17% of the projected amount earned by November. Media reports suggest that major disinvestments planned by the government may not materialize as expected, further complicating the fiscal situation. To address the deficit issue, the government might have to consider either cutting down on expenditure, which could negatively impact growth, or adopting strategies like delaying payments for expenditures, which would not be reflected in the government's books but would require borrowing by institutions like the Food Corporation of India to meet their obligations."

    "reference": "India's financial situation, which had shown signs of improvement with the Reserve Bank of India's \"operation twist\" aimed at lowering interest rates on long-term loans, faces new uncertainties due to geopolitical tensions. Following Iran's vow to seek revenge against the US for the killing of a top commander, oil prices may escalate, impacting India's finances significantly as it imports over three-quarters of its oil. India's exports have been stagnant, and a sharp increase in the country's import bill could widen the trade deficit, putting pressure on the fiscal deficit. Lowering retail fuel prices to offset the impact of rising oil prices could strain the government's fiscal position. However, increasing fuel prices may lead to inflation concerns, potentially necessitating tighter monetary policy from the central bank, which could negatively affect market rates and borrowing costs. India has benefited from relatively stable oil prices in recent years, allowing the government to collect higher tax revenues from fuel. But with the potential for increased oil price volatility due to geopolitical factors, the country may face new complexities and economic challenges."

    "reference": "ndia's aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy requires consistent economic growth. To achieve this, India would need to grow at an 8% real rate with a 0.7% increase in Total Factor Productivity (TFP). Understanding the relationship between TFP and economic growth is essential. Factors for Economic Growth: Economic growth relies on inputs such as labor and capital utilized for productive purposes, along with factor productivity. As more people are employed and capital accumulates over time, the quantity of labor and capital increases in an economy. Increased productivity enables an economy to grow more quickly using the same resources. Total Factor Productivity (TFP): TFP is calculated as the ratio of total production to the weighted average of inputs (e.g., labor and capital). It reflects the additional growth in real output beyond the growth in inputs. Higher TFP indicates greater growth with the same labor and capital inputs. TFP is a critical factor for achieving economic growth. Evolution of TFP Growth in India: India has seen fluctuations in TFP growth over the years. It played a significant role in India's economic growth between 2005 and 2007. However, in recent years, TFP growth has been inconsistent, which has contributed to the current economic slowdown. Global Trend on TFP Growth: Since 2008, TFP growth has been slower in most nations. China has experienced negative TFP growth since 2012. Nations with 8% or higher GDP growth typically had TFP growth above 3%. Recent evidence suggests that TFP might have a more substantial impact on GDP growth than fixed capital. Factors Affecting TFP: India can enhance its TFP by implementing market and structural reforms to unlock productive capacity, particularly in the primary sector of the economy. These reforms could facilitate the reallocation of land and labor from the primary sector to other sectors, leading to increased productivity. Investments in physical infrastructure, such as highways and human capital, can also boost TFP. In summary, India's journey to a $5 trillion economy is closely linked to TFP growth. Implementing reforms and making strategic investments are vital steps in improving TFP and fostering sustainable economic growth."

The case sparked widespread protests and demands for justice. While this particular case met the judiciary's criteria for capital punishment as the \"rarest of rare,\" it raises questions about whether all rapists should routinely receive the death penalty, as some Indians advocate. The efficacy of the death penalty as a deterrent remains a subject of debate, and many sexual assault cases are complex with inconclusive evidence. Striking the right balance between strict standards of evidence to secure convictions and the risk of wrongful executions is challenging. India already has a low rape conviction rate, which could decrease further if capital punishment is widely imposed. Each execution should be an occasion for solemn reflection, not only on the penalty itself but also on the broader questions surrounding the death penalty for sexual crimes."

The e-commerce giants are accused of providing significant discounts to customers through select preferred sellers, while excluding others from the same opportunities. They are also alleged to manipulate search algorithms to give preference to their favored sellers. These practices are said to distort competition and potentially harm other sellers, preventing them from having equal access to online marketplaces. Additionally, CCI is investigating whether the firms have been using their funding to cross-subsidize deep discounts, thus creating high entry barriers for new competitors. The investigation aims to ensure competition and efficiency in the e-commerce sector without compromising the interests of consumers."

This growth is attributed to a recovery in developed countries and a nearly 15% depreciation of the Indian rupee in the current financial year. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) estimates that exports will reach $121 billion in the last four months of the year, compared to $97.6 billion during the same period in the previous year. Factors contributing to this positive outlook include measures announced in the revised foreign trade policy, the rupee's depreciation, and a favorable base from the previous year. The strengthening Indian currency and improved economic conditions in the US and the Eurozone have also contributed to this growth. Engineering exports, which are the third-largest export sector in India, are expected to rise by 22% in the four months starting September. However, opinions within the industry vary, with some expecting only a 10% growth due to factors like rising steel costs.

A well-thought-out batting order with players assigned specific roles and responsibilities is crucial for the team's success. Openers need to capitalize on the new ball and fielding restrictions, while the No. 3 batsman should anchor the innings. Numbers 4 and 5 need to be flexible and adapt to the situation, and the lower order should consist of power-hitters who can finish strongly. For India's T20 lineup, Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, and Rohit Sharma could open the innings. Once Dhawan returns, Rahul can move to No. 4. No. 5 remains open for competition between Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, and others. Rishabh Pant can provide firepower at No. 6, with Ravindra Jadeja or Hardik Pandya at No. 7. Flexibility and a clear strategy are key to a successful batting order. Some of the best batting line-ups in cricket history include the 1975 West Indies team with players like Roy Fredericks, Gordon Greenidge, Alvin Kallicharran, Rohan Kanhai, Clive Lloyd, and Vivian Richards. Australia in the early 2000s also had a formidable lineup. While conditions can influence batting orders, flexibility should not lead to unnecessary tinkering that disrupts team stability. It's important to have settled positions, such as the crucial No. 4 spot. Ajinkya Rahane's decline in ODI form and frequent changes in the No. 4 position have been unsettling for India.

However, owning a home provides a permanent address, which is significant for many, and can be practical for families with school-going children. If the goal is to live in the house, buying can be a good idea if it's affordable. On the other hand, buying a house as an investment is often discouraged. Housing returns have been mediocre, with the National Housing Bank's Residex showing an average return of 4.8% per year between June 2013 and June 2019. This return is relatively low compared to the risk and expenses associated with real estate investments. Additionally, there have been changes in tax benefits related to home loans, making the case for buying a home as an investment less appealing."

This allows authorities to identify individuals with higher body temperatures, potentially indicating a fever. While thermal scanners can be effective in identifying potential cases, further screening and testing are required to confirm if someone is infected with the coronavirus. These scanners are widely used in various sectors, including law enforcement, military, and firefighting, and have been deployed during previous outbreaks like SARS and Ebola."

Furthermore, children missing school can be attributed to various factors, including the tendency of impoverished families to prioritize immediate economic needs over long-term education.

    "reference": "In recent years, India's banking crisis, primarily driven by high non-performing assets (NPAs), has led banks to shift their focus from secured lending to unsecured credit for personal loans. This change has raised concerns about a substantial portion of these loans going to subprime borrowers \u2013 individuals with a higher risk of loan default due to lower credit ratings and past delinquencies. Subprime borrowers typically face higher interest rates to account for the elevated default risk. While competition in consumer lending and developments in technology have facilitated lending to subprime borrowers, many fear this shift may pose risks to the financial system.

    "reference": "The budget for 2020-21, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has been closely scrutinized, particularly in light of the fiscal challenges India faces. Here are some key points regarding the budget: Tax Revenue Projections: The budget has faced criticism for possibly overestimating revenue projections. The gross tax revenue growth for 2020-21 is projected at 12%, which is faster than the nominal GDP growth projection of 10%. In the previous budget, overestimations led to a revenue shortfall. Fiscal Deficit Numbers: The budget acknowledges the fiscal challenges to some extent. For the fiscal year 2019-20, the fiscal deficit is projected at 3.8% of GDP, higher than the initial target of 3.3%. For 2020-21, the projected fiscal deficit is 3.5%, against the 3% target set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act. Off-Budget Borrowing: The budget continues the practice of off-budget borrowing, but it has transparently disclosed these items. This disclosure reveals that the total borrowing for 2019-20 amounts to 4.6% of GDP, which is more than the fiscal deficit figure of 3.8% of GDP. Fiscal Strain: To address the fiscal deficit, structural corrections are needed in both expenditure and tax revenue. However, the budget does not introduce concrete measures to tackle tax evasion or expand the tax base. It relies on one-time receipts and borrowings from the National Small Savings Fund. Stimulating Growth: The budget does not provide a substantial stimulus for growth. The fiscal space is limited due to the government's strained finances. Some allocations have increased, while others have decreased. The budget's fiscal deficit projection and reliance on one-time receipts have raised concerns about the government's ability to manage its fiscal position effectively. The impact of this budget on India's economic growth and fiscal health will be closely watched as the year progressess"

Many Kerala Muslims contend that triple talaq is not practiced in God's Own Country but writer Dr Khadija Mumtaz opposes this claim. \" In my opinion, the Supreme Court striking down the practice of divorcing a wife by saying talaq three times alone will not bring much change as long as the concept of talaq - a right to leave one's wife outside of the law - still exists. The only difference will be that a husband will be required to say one talaq every three months. This privilege of the Muslim male to leave his wife without getting a legal divorce should also be banned. She argues that as long as polygamy is legal, there won't be peace for women. \""

Chief Justice Chandrachu's prompt action makes it unequivocally clear that further delays are unacceptable, sending a resolute message to the government regarding the urgency of resolution. The initiative to reopen this case has been spearheaded by members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). They have compellingly argued their case, highlighting the fact that a substantial 95% of anonymous donations, particularly in the form of electoral bonds, seem to favor a single political entity. The confidentiality surrounding these contributions is anchored in the provisions of the Finance Act of 2017, operating under the Representation of the People Act of 1951.

But often in religious tensions, God and Human both are forgotten. I was born into the Christian religious faith but my ancestral roots are Indic. I am aware that a duress or an allurement or simple faith would have led to their conversion centuries ago when Goa witnessed a brutal inquisition. Sometimes, I get advised on social media and outside by some proponents of the Hindu religion that I should convert from Christianity to the Sanatan Dharma faith. Their advice, I believe come from their limited understanding of Sanatan Dharma and Christianity. Christianity is a religious faith centred around the belief of salvation if you believe or damnation if you do not believe in the path professed under the Christian faith. I have grown up believing in some of its tenets and also questioning some of its tenets. I believe in the teachings of Jesus for its simplicity and its application in real life with people around you.

This suggests that they are continuing to investigate and collect more evidence to determine the actual cause of the hospital explosion."

A rise in world population and disposable income has fuelled demand for energy. Growth in global energy consumption has averaged one percent per year for the last five decades. This led to the adoption of advanced exploration and production (E&P) technology, which facilitated higher output and efficiency. As numerous oil and gas facilities age worldwide, scores of virgin territories have been accessed for exploration. This despite the increase in initiatives towards reducing inveterate dependence on fossil fuels to ensure a healthier future.",
    "reference": "Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, discussions about energy and transitioning to greener alternatives have been a focal point in various meetings and conferences. The world's population has been growing, and people have more money to spend, which has driven up the demand for energy. Over the last five decades, global energy consumption has been steadily increasing at an average rate of about one percent each year. To keep up with this demand, there has been a significant shift towards using advanced exploration and production (E&P) technologies, which help extract energy resources more efficiently. Interestingly, despite the efforts to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels for a more sustainable future, many aging oil and gas facilities continue to operate, and new areas are being explored for energy production. This indicates the ongoing struggle to wean ourselves off fossil fuels and transition to cleaner, more environmentally friendly energy sources."

The company also anticipates a decline in revenue for the third quarter, estimating a drop of 3.5% to 1.5% on a constant currency basis. They attribute this decline to a significant reduction in discretionary spending by their clients, which means clients are cutting back on non-essential expenses. This projection is lower than the guidance they had provided for the second quarter, which was in the range of -2% to +1%. In essence, the company is bracing for a more substantial revenue decline in the upcoming quarter due to client spending constraints."

Oman ranked as the world's most \"efficient\" health system in terms of outcomes, while countries in sub-Saharan Africa had the poorest performance records according to the WHO analysis. Researchers evaluated healthcare system efficiency by comparing spending with the outcome in terms of life expectancy improvement. Oman's top ranking is attributed to a significant reduction in child mortality over the past 40 years.

The Congress, which ruled the mountainous state for many years alternatively since it became statehood in 1987 and was in power till 2018, when it was ousted by the MNF, would field candidates in all 40 seats.

Two, states have a duty to defend their citizens and defend justice.

The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just cause, being a last resort, being declared by a proper authority, possessing the right intention, having a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means used. The Catholic Church recognizes that a nation has not just the right, but the obligation to ensure the security of its citizens and to respond to aggression, even \u2013 if only under very strict conditions \u2013 by means of military force. In July 2022, Pope Francis during a 90-minute interview with Telam, the news agency of the Argentine state, answered a question about lack of dialogue being an aggravating factor for a world that he believes is currently living a piecemeal Third World War stated: I believe it is time to rethink the concept of a \u2018just war\u2019. A war may be just; there is the right to defend oneself. But we need to rethink the way that concept is used nowadays. I have said that the use and possession of nuclear weapons are immoral. Resolving conflicts through war is saying no to verbal reasoning, to being constructive. But interestingly in March 2022, Pope Francis opined that there is no such thing as a just war; when he spoke about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Israel is not attacking Palestine. Israel is at war with Hamas. Hamas is a terror organization. A war against a terror organization, however, is not the same as a war about territory. It is a new kind of war.

    "reference": "In 2014, Jayalalithaa, the late former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), declared that there would be no alliance or tie-up between her party and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or the Indian National Congress for the 2014 general elections in India. This statement indicated her party's intention to maintain political independence and not enter into any formal alliances with the two major national parties. It's worth noting that political alliances in Indian elections can often play a crucial role in shaping the outcome, as they allow regional and national parties to pool their resources and support. Jayalalithaa's decision not to align with either the BJP or Congress reflected her focus on asserting her party's autonomy and pursuing her own political agenda. The political landscape in India is characterized by complex alliances and realignments, and Jayalalithaa's statement was a significant development in the lead-up to the 2014 general elections, which ultimately saw the BJP securing a majority and forming the central government."

    "reference": "In 2013, during a period of economic uncertainty and job instability, some retrenched or laid-off workers found themselves taking on casual or temporary jobs. These casual jobs were often characterized by their lack of long-term job security, benefits, and stable income, as they were usually short-term or part-time positions. The reasons for this could vary. Economic downturns, company restructuring, or changes in the job market may have forced workers to accept these casual positions as a means of earning income while they searched for more stable employment. Casual work can include jobs in various sectors such as retail, hospitality, seasonal labor, and gig economy work. It's important to note that casual or temporary work can provide a stopgap solution for individuals facing unemployment, but it may not offer the same level of stability and security as permanent employment. Retrenched workers often strive to transition back into more stable, long-term roles as the job market improves. The phenomenon of retrenched workers taking on casual jobs in times of economic uncertainty reflects the flexibility and adaptability of the labor force during challenging economic circumstances."

Hayden suggests that the team's decision to use Ravindra Jadeja as a solution might result in balance issues and fragility. In the world of cricket, achieving the right balance in a team is crucial. While Pandya is known for his explosive batting and can be a game-changer with the ball, Jadeja's inclusion might be viewed as an effort to strengthen India's lower-order batting and add a spin-bowling option. However, Hayden's comments indicate that this approach might have drawbacks in terms of team dynamics and performance. The \"fragility\" mentioned likely pertains to the team's overall strength and stability, implying that relying too heavily on one or the other may not be an ideal solution. Cricket teams often grapple with these balancing acts, as they aim to field a team that can perform optimally across different conditions and against various opponents. Hayden's comments reflect ongoing discussions and debates within the cricketing community about how to best utilize all-rounders like Pandya and the potential trade-offs in terms of team composition and strategy.

    "reference": "The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has received approval to construct twin tunnels under Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). However, this project will involve the felling of 122 trees. The project is associated with Chief Minister Shinde's initiatives. The construction of twin tunnels under the national park is a significant infrastructure development in the Mumbai metropolitan region. It could potentially lead to improved connectivity and transportation options, benefiting the local population and the city's overall transportation network. However, the felling of trees is a point of concern, as it can have environmental and ecological implications, particularly in a protected area like SGNP. Balancing infrastructure development with environmental conservation is a complex challenge faced by many urban areas. Projects like this often require careful planning and mitigation measures to minimize their impact on the environment and local ecosystems. It's essential to stay updated on the progress of the project, the mitigation measures in place, and any protests or concerns from environmental and conservation groups to ensure that development occurs in a sustainable and responsible manner."

The treasure room, known as the \"Ratna Bhandar,\" is believed to contain valuable jewelry, ornaments, and other sacred items. Tradition and religious practices have led to the room being sealed for centuries, with access strictly controlled. 2. Security and Preservation: The decision to keep the treasure room locked is also based on concerns about security and preserving the temple's cultural heritage. Opening it could risk theft, damage, or mismanagement of these valuable assets. 3. Legal and Government Intervention: In recent years, there have been demands to open the treasure room, primarily driven by legal actions and public interest petitions. Some argue that the temple's assets should be audited, and their value should be put to public use. 4. Transparency and Accountability: Proponents of opening the treasure room argue that it's essential to ensure transparency and accountability in the management of temple assets and to assess their true value for cultural and religious purposes.

However, achieving this goal sustainably depends on ensuring that those who produce the food receive reasonable economic returns that can withstand the test of time. This resilience is intimately tied to the health of our natural ecosystem because agriculture relies heavily on essential natural resources, including soil, water, and climate conditions. Recognizing the interconnectedness between nutritional security, livelihoods, and environmental well-being is crucial to create a truly sustainable food system. In simpler terms, ensuring that people have enough to eat is not enough; we must also consider the economic well-being of those who produce the food and the health of the environment that supports this production.

    "reference": "A low-pressure system in the Arabian Sea is forecasted to intensify into a cyclonic storm. This development can have significant implications for the region and may lead to adverse weather conditions, potentially affecting coastal areas. Here are some key points to consider: 1. **Low-Pressure System:** Low-pressure systems are areas of relatively lower atmospheric pressure. They can serve as the breeding grounds for cyclonic activity, particularly in the oceanic regions. 2. Arabian Sea: The Arabian Sea is located to the west of the Indian subcontinent. Cyclonic storms in this region can bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and rough seas, impacting the coastal areas of countries bordering the sea, such as India, Pakistan, Oman, and others. 3. Intensification: When a low-pressure system intensifies into a cyclonic storm, it means that the system's winds and overall organization become more pronounced, potentially leading to the formation of a tropical cyclone. 4. Adverse Weather: Cyclonic storms can bring adverse weather conditions, including heavy rainfall, strong winds, storm surges, and potential flooding. These conditions can pose risks to lives and property in affected areas. 5. Weather Updates: It's crucial for local authorities, residents, and mariners to closely monitor weather updates and advisories provided by meteorological agencies. They provide valuable information for preparedness and safety measures. 6. Response and Preparedness: Governments in the region often have response and preparedness plans in place to deal with cyclonic storms. This includes evacuation plans, relief efforts, and coordination with disaster management agencies. 7. Impact Assessment: After the event, it's important to conduct impact assessments to understand the extent of damage caused by the cyclonic storm and plan for recovery and reconstruction. Cyclonic storms in the Arabian Sea can have varying levels of intensity, and their behavior can be unpredictable. Therefore, it's essential to stay informed and heed the guidance of local authorities to ensure the safety of individuals and communities in the affected areas."

Circuit Boards and Protection: High-quality chargers and official cables, such as Apple's Lightning cable, contain tiny circuit boards that serve multiple purposes. One chip authenticates the cable as a genuine Apple product, while another chip acts as a fuse to isolate charger damage. In the event of a power fluctuation, the charger takes the damage, protecting the connected device. 2. USB-C Cable Variability: USB-C cables may look similar, but cheaper, low-quality cords often lack the protective chips found in high-quality cables. This means they don't offer the same level of protection for your electronic devices. 3. Invest in Quality: It's recommended not to opt for cheap USB-C cables, such as those available at gas station kiosks. Instead, invest in durable cables from reputable companies like Anker, Belkin, or Amazon Basics. These cables typically cost between $9 to $30. To ensure authenticity and quality, buy cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves. 4. Device Protection:The passage underscores the importance of being cautious about what you plug into your electronic devices. Using subpar or low-quality cables and chargers can result in potential damage or malfunction of your devices.

    "reference": "The Triple Talaq Bill, also known as the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, is criticized for being an unfair legislative move with a populist agenda. The author argues that it reflects a sectarian bias and distorts the Supreme Court's judgment in the Shayara Bano case. The Bill proposes to criminalize an act that has no legal effect due to the Supreme Court's ruling, which is seen as contradictory. Additionally, the majority verdict in Shayara Bano did not call for the criminalization of triple talaq. The author believes that criminalizing triple talaq may not serve the best interests of Muslim women and could lead to unintended consequences. The article contends that the Bill may undermine principles of equality before the law and secularism in the Indian Constitution."

Vasundhara's name figured in the second list of 83 candidates for Rajasthan declared by the BJP on Saturday. She was fielded from her traditional Jhalarapatan seat she has been representing. ADVERTISEMENT Ads by The names of many loyalists of Vasundhara also figured in the second list, indicating that the BJP leadership was not willing to take any risks. Making a U-turn, the BJP also fielded Narpat Singh Rajvi, the son-in-law of late BJP stalwart Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who was denied nomination from his sitting seat in the first list. Rajvi, who had strongly protested after being dropped, was fielded from Chittorgarh.

The government, they said, will launch a mega drive, Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, across all 2.7 lakh panchayats in the country to reach out to beneficiaries and enrol them. The sources said the exercise will begin after Diwali next month and continue for several weeks. Specially fitted 'raths' will reach the beneficiaries across the country, they added. In a recent Cabinet meeting, Modi exhorted his colleagues to work harder and ensure that deserving beneficiaries who have still not got the benefits of welfare schemes are reached out to faster, they said. Advertisement During a meeting with top officials, he underlined the need to expedite the saturation of welfare schemes. \"He said he wants all his schemes to reach full saturation in the next six months,\" a source said. The drive will ensure the saturation of schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Grameen), National Rural Livelihood Mission, PM KISAN, Fasal Bima Yojana, Poshan Abhiyan, Ujjwala Yojana, Ayushman Bharat, Janaushadhi Yojana and the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, besides skill development schemes and the recently launched Vishwakarma Yojana, they said. Modi has repeatedly stressed the need for saturation of welfare schemes, asserting that such an approach also rules out any discrimination and takes welfare initiatives to every deserving citizen. The saturation drive comes as the ruling BJP gears up for the Lok Sabha polls, likely to be held in April-May next year, under the leadership of Modi who will seek a third straight term after leading the party to two back-to-back big wins in the general elections in 2014 and 2019. Addressing a gathering at an event to mark the foundation day of the Scindia School in Gwalior, Modi said his government's emphasis was on welfare measures to curb poverty. He told members of the audience to hand-hold at least one poverty-stricken family. One should not rest until each and every poor person is covered under welfare schemes, including those for cooking gas, housing, bank accounts and health insurance, Modi said. \"It is necessary to rid India of poverty. Following this path, over 13.5 crore people have been lifted out of poverty. Following this path, India will remove poverty and become developed too,\" he said"

    "reference": "The Anya Self Help Group in Naharlagun constructed a new hanging bridge over the Lagun Nallah through a two-day mass social service initiative to help connect the communities of Upper Damsite and Tigdo Colony. The previous bamboo bridge had washed away twice due to flash flooding in September, causing difficulties for residents. The women members of the Anya SHG took the lead to construct a replacement bridge through community self-help efforts. Their actions provided an important logistical link between the villages after the floods destroyed previous crossings. Tigdo Colony was one of the worst hit areas from the devastating 2008 floods, which washed away many homes there. Even two years later, the community had yet to fully recover from the damage. By building the new bridge over the Lagun Nallah, the Anya SHG helped restore an essential transportation route while also strengthening bonds between neighborhoods. Their grassroots project made meaningful progress in rebuilding infrastructure and resiliency for inhabitants still coping with the aftermath of natural disasters."

    "reference": "Researchers in Arunachal Pradesh have discovered a previously unknown language called Koro spoken by about 800 people in West Kameng district. They initially thought Koro was a dialect of the Aka language, as the speakers culturally identify as Aka. However, the team from the National Geographic's Enduring Voices project found Koro has a distinct vocabulary and linguistic structure from Aka. Even the Koro speakers were unaware it was a separate language and considered it just a dialect. But researchers documented differences in words for body parts, numbers and other concepts between Koro and Aka, establishing Koro as a unique language in its own right. Koro is so divergent from other Tibeto-Burman languages that the team could find no close relatives. Remarkably, Koro has survived for years within the Aka community despite intermarriage and shared traditions. Linguists hope to learn how the small Koro population maintained their tongue in these circumstances. They announced the discovery of Koro, an endangered and unwritten language, to raise awareness of the diversity of languages in North East India that remain understudied."

    "reference": "A recent survey by a Delhi-based NGO found government schools in Arunachal Pradesh are becoming deserted as more children enroll in private schools. The poor condition of infrastructure in government schools is driving parents away despite most residents relying on them. The survey visited schools across districts and found 83% of 6-16 year olds attend government schools, 10% private, and 0.5% central schools. Worryingly, 6% don't attend any school. Dropout rates are also high at 12.5-13.9% for boys and girls aged 15-16, often due to financial constraints. Most disturbing is the lack of pre-school access especially in rural areas, impacting later attendance and dropout. While teacher attendance is around 80%, infrastructure is lacking - 24.4% of primary schools lack water supply, 30.8-11.8% lack toilets, and 88.4-57% of schools lack separate girls' toilets. The report is damning of the government's failure to provide even basic facilities and attract children, undermining its education policy goals. Urgent reforms are needed to improve infrastructure, retain students and reduce dropout rates."

    "reference": "The House of Representatives is set to vote on the likely impeachment of President Donald Trump. The impeachment inquiry stems from a whistleblower's complaint, alleging Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Trump denies wrongdoing, insisting his call with Ukraine's president was appropriate. Impeachment hearings featured witnesses, but the White House resisted subpoenas. Two articles of impeachment were approved, accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Opinion polls show a divided public. With Democrats holding a House majority, impeachment is likely, but a Senate trial requires a two-thirds majority for removal, making acquittal probable given the Republican majority."

The judges had alleged that there was a \"selective roster\" for allocating cases, and that cases were being assigned to \"preferred\" judges. The four judges had also alleged that there was \"interference\" in the allocation of cases, and that the CJI was not consulting with other judges on important matters."

The government acknowledges the risk of these traditions disappearing if not actively preserved and promoted. The importance of safeguarding indigenous languages and customs is highlighted, as these have been impacted by the dominance of Hindi and English, as well as influences from other religions. The challenge lies in maintaining these traditions while adapting to changing times. Efforts to document languages and create scripts have been made by some communities, but the larger push for a common language threatens the survival of many native dialects. The new department's effectiveness in preserving these cultural and faith traditions, including languages, will become clearer over time. It is essential for younger generations to value and learn their native languages alongside mastering foreign languages. Otherwise, the risk is that these rich cultural practices and languages may fade away, leaving only memories and digital reproductions."

(File photo)By Express News Service BHUBANESWAR: In a move that came as no surprise, VK Pandian, the power centre of Naveen Patnaik government has taken voluntary retirement from All India Civil Services cementing speculations over a full-time political role. Pandian was private secretary to the Chief Minister of Odisha. The Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India, on Monday approved his request for Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), waiving the notice period as recommended by the state government. The 2000-batch IAS officer who has been the private secretary to Naveen since 2011 had slowly taken complete control of the government machinery with the Chief Minister taking a backseat in recent years. With the 2024 elections barely months away, Pandian\u2019s retirement has given shape to a big churn in Odisha politics. His next move seems no mystery as his way of functioning in recent years had drawn allegations about completely blurring the line between the officialdom and political leadership in the state. Pandian, who also served as 5T Secretary to the State Government, had taken centrestage in the Naveen Patnaik government with not only the bureaucracy but also the entire Biju Janata Dal looking up to him as the representative of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. While till 2019 elections, Pandian chose to stay behind the curtains, the massive mandate spurred him to step out of the shadows and become the face and voice of Naveen Patnaik. He has ever since been hailed as Naveen\u2019s political strategist with full control of the government and BJD politics. Naveen too made no bones about conveying the message that Pandian was his blue-eyed boy. His sharp political acumen was reflected in the move to create a 5T Initiatives Department which subsumed all wings of the government making them reportable to him. With Naveen reposing his complete trust in Pandian, the IAS officer gave shape to grand projects and programmes of the government aligning with BJD\u2019s political goals. From 2019, all the mega projects such as Sri Jagannath Heritage Corridor, temple redevelopments across the state, school and college transformation programme, health sector initiatives, rural and urban transformation etc have been his brainchild and conducted under his direct supervision. While there had been consistent murmurs against the way of functioning of Pandian, his extensive tours to districts in the last four months, where he not only addressed the local grievances on the spot but also made a slew of announcements, drew sharp criticism from the opposition political as well as sections within the BJD. As the state BJP came all guns blazing, criticizing his authority as an IAS officer to conduct programmes with blatant political overtones, his tours were also questioned by senior BJD leader and MLA Soumya Ranjan Patnaik. The controversy was set to rest with Naveen clarifying that the IAS officer was his representative, sent by him to listen to people and solve their issues at their doorsteps. The Opposition BJP and Congress had also challenged Pandian to quit service and join full-time politics.

The opposition believes that Pandian will likely be given a Cabinet rank in the government so that he continues to enjoy the same power."

Immig Toronto | Sponsored Avoid Grammatical Errors with This Helpful Desktop App Grammarly | Sponsored Cricket Fans May Make Money While Watching Matches Now Cricket | Search Ads | Sponsored What impacted rural consumption? Rural demand was hit hard by the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic. It never really recovered from there. Unseasonal rainfall in the first quarter of 2023-24 resulted in significant crop damage and lower output. In the second quarter, the erratic monsoon hurt crop sowing. Add to that higher inflation which meant costlier food and other essential items. In fact, rural inflation in September 2023 was higher at 5.33% than urban inflation of 4.65%. Hit by higher costs and lower income, rural consumers held back their non-essential spending, delaying further the revival in rural demand. What explains the growth in consumption in 2022-23? It grew 7.5%, driven by urban demand. Consumers in cities spent, confident of their future. The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s consumer confidence index touched a 4-year high in September. RBI data showed rising household liabilities as consumers borrowed and splurged. A NielsenIQ study shows a 10% urban volume growth as against rural\u2019s 7% in Q2FY24. How critical is rural demand for India? The bulk of India lives in rural areas. A strong rural economy is a pre-requisite for faster economic growth as it fuels consumption, an important engine of growth. In FY23, India was able to post a 7.2% GDP growth thanks to strong growth in private consumption. This consumption growth came largely from the urban centres. If India has to consistently register a GDP growth in excess of 8%, rural consumption has to be strong. That would need a good monsoon, strong agricultural output and good prices for the produce. What is the outlook for rural demand? Some consumer companies are seeing green shoots as they head into the festival season. Most of them are hoping for a turnaround in rural consumption. But a lot will depend on water levels in the reservoirs and crop output as the Southwest monsoon has been erratic. Global factors are also at play. Oil prices have risen due to the Israel-Palestine conflict. This could push up inflation in India. Price increase affects the rural population a lot more than urban consumers and any revival in rural demand will have to wait. \"Exciting news!

Recent data shows that in 1999, there were 928 deaths and just 276 births in the community. Factors contributing to this decline include late marriages, progressive attitudes towards women, emigration to other countries, and marriages outside the community. The community is divided on issues like mixed marriages and who should be considered a Parsi Zoroastrian. Some believe that the future of the community lies in the North American continent due to the expanding diaspora there, while others argue that maintaining cultural and religious practices is more important. The community is making efforts to boost numbers through initiatives like reservations in employment and education, holiday programs, and incentives for couples with a third child.

    "reference": "Goa is home to two Lok Sabha seats. One from North Goa and one from South Goa. North Goa has been won by one of BJP Goa\u2019s most senior political leaders Shripad Naik for the last four terms giving the BJP an edge in the runup to Lok Sabha 2024. Naik is currently a Minister of State for Ports, Shipping, and Waterways at the Centre. Grapevine in Goa and at the Centre is that BJP will go into the fight for North Goa with Shripad Naik, though there are some quarters within the political power circle locally who want a replacement for Shripad Naik in North Goa, citing his age as being one of the concerns and a need to push a young leader from BJP Goa to Centre-based politics. South Goa, however, remains a conundrum for the BJP and Congress alike. However, the route that will be taken by Congress is predictable and expected in their line of thought. BJP on the other hand won the South Goa seat in 2014 when the Late Manohar Parrikar who was then the Chief Minister of Goa led the BJP and guided the BJP Lok Sabha candidate Narendra Sawaikar to victory. In 2019, both Parrikar and Sawaikar could not repeat the magic of 2014, even though BJP-led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi won the hearts of people across India. The people of South Goa thought differently from the rest of India, they decided to put their faith in the Congress and its candidate Francisco Sardinha. South Goa in 2024 for the BJP is not going to be an easy walk for the BJP, even though some of the BJP leaders in Goa and at the Centre believe that Narendra Modi as the Prime Ministerial face and that BJP\u2019s people-centric schemes are enough to encourage the people of South Goa to vote for the BJP Lok Sabha candidate. While it might be true to some extent and in some pockets of South Goa that Prime Minister Modi is a face that would encourage a South Goa voter to vote for the BJP, it is not enough a face to counter the onslaught of the hardcore anti-BJP, anti-RSS and anti-Modi Christian lobby that South Goa also houses. More so, sometimes the most obvious truth is overlooked by the leaders in Goa and at the Centre that the Christians in Goa tend to influence their liberal Hindu voter friends who believe in the Indianised version of the definition of secularism popularised by the Congress and who see the BJP, RSS and Narendra Modi as communal and not working in the interest of their idea of a secular India. The split of votes is not going to be a phenomenon that would work in the favour of the BJP in the Lok Sabha 2024 in Goa because the fight is largely going to be between the Congress candidate and the BJP candidate. Other political parties would undoubtedly put their candidates to stay relevant in Goan politics but the people of South Goa are going to elect someone from the Congress or the BJP to send to the parliament in Lok Sabha. The folly of the BJP would be to think that now that it has a considerable presence in South Goa after eight MLAs of the Congress joined the BJP, some of whom are from constituencies in South Goa it has a better chance to win. In 2019, 10 Congress MLAs joined the BJP but they did not perform well in the Goa State Assembly Election 2022. Another confidence yardstick is the assumption that now that it has the support of the MGP which it did not have in 2019 and therefore Lok Sabha 2024 would be a walk in the park for the party since its loss in 2019 was about 9000-odd votes. It is not going to be a journey without thorns for the BJP because right now the Catholic Church in Goa which holds sway over the Christian voter base does not have confidence in the BJP to maintain the social fabric, so intrinsic to Goa. The loss of the BJP in Karnataka where the Christians, Muslims and some sections of the Hindu community came together to play a decisive path in keeping the BJP out of the government. The ongoing Manipur conflict between the Meitei and Kuki communities was portrayed by certain sections on the social media and mainstream media as Hindu and Christian conflagration with state and centre allowing the Christians to be victimised. Though the propagated story on Manipur is not the truth on the ground, the silence of Prime Minister Modi over the conflict in Manipur for 80 days allowed for the negativity to spread among the Christian community in most parts of India, mostly in Goa and Goans living in other parts of India and other parts of the world. Manipur will have an impact in the 2024 elections especially in the Christian community. More so, the recent conflagration incidents between Hindus, Christians and Muslims in Goa triggered by people intending to cause communal strife in the state is causing some discomfort in most communities, especially the minority communities. Several other moot points propagated by the opposition have been aimed at influencing the minority community to dislike the BJP and believe that Narendra Modi is an incarnation of Adolf Hitler. Shockingly, the minorities and some liberal Hindus find it easier to believe that Narendra Modi is like Hitler who history has shown was a man who sent six million Jews to their graves in the most horrific way, when instead Prime Minister Modi has been working with inclusivity to ensure minorities are not deprived of their fundamental rights and equal opportunities in India. Over the South Goa candidate for Lok Sabha, BJP has a conundrum, a large section of the local leadership believes that the party should follow a tried and tested method which had seen success in 2014, a Hindu face with a 15 and 20 per cent decent Christian voter base because a large section of the Hindu voters will vote for the BJP in a highly polarised election because it is assumed that Hindus will vote for BJP. Interestingly, South Goa has more Hindu voters than Christian voters, 53.34 per cent Hindu voters, 36.21 per cent Christian voters and 9.93 per cent Muslim voters but the Hindu consolidation did not take place as expected in 2019 and neither did the Christians repose enough faith in BJP for Sawaikar to win the election. In 2014, it was Parrikar\u2019s outreach with the Catholic Church leaders and Christian community along with Sawaikar\u2019s connection with all communities that worked as a winning formula but it was not successful in 2019 because there was a dent in the relationship between BJP and the Catholic Church. There is another school of thought being mooted at the Centre in some circles of decision-making on whether BJP should in South Goa put a Christian face with a balanced Hindu voter base and a considerable Christian voter base. More importantly, someone who can be groomed to be a Christian face of the BJP at the Centre. And with Goa often being seen politically in India and internationally as a Christian-dominated state even though it is not, it would seem as a prudent decision to have a pro-BJP Christian face emerge from preferably Goa. Kerala and North-East would be other states the BJP would be looking towards grooming young Christian leaders in the BJP. Some believe that it could be a tactful decision if the BJP could groom one of its existing Christian MLAs from South Goa or a Christian leader to become a national face of India from Goa from the Christian community. Interestingly, there is yet another school of thought in a small section of the local leadership, that the BJP could consider someone from the SC/ST community from South Goa. In fact, prominent leaders from the SC/ST communities have been jostling for this option with one such leader making the rounds of the central leadership in New Delhi and has been confiding to his well-wishers that he could be the dark horse of the BJP for the LS 2024. And there is no doubt that out of the potential six names doing the rounds, he tops the list. However, what would make it interesting is if the BJP can find a Christian from the SC/ST community. Or will the BJP go with an old Hindu face or a new Hindu face; Or will the BJP have the confidence in putting a Christian face in South Goa when it appears that Congress most certainly will go in with a Christian face for LS 2024 or could they decide to put a Hindu face with a strong Christian following to checkmate BJP? Only time will tell."

    "reference": "The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is reportedly taking measures to bolster liquidity in the Indian financial system by considering the rollover of a portion of a $5-billion forex swap. This move aims to inject additional funds into the market and ensure that financial institutions have the necessary liquidity to function effectively.

In this case, the RBI's intention to roll over a portion of the forex swap signifies its commitment to maintaining stability and liquidity in the financial markets. Adequate liquidity is essential for the proper functioning of financial institutions, especially in times of economic uncertainty or disruptions. This proactive approach by the RBI is in line with its primary responsibilities of managing monetary policy and ensuring the overall financial stability of the country. It reflects the central bank's commitment to supporting the financial sector during challenging times, such as those brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. By providing banks with foreign currency funds, the RBI aims to stabilize exchange rates and fulfill foreign exchange needs, which is vital for India's economic growth and stability. The RBI's strategy reflects its dedication to mitigating potential liquidity issues and maintaining economic equilibrium. This move is expected to provide essential support to the Indian financial system."

This initiative, which encourages drivers to turn off their vehicles' engines at red traffic lights, is part of efforts to combat air pollution in the city. The resurgence of this campaign underscores the severity of air pollution in Delhi, which has been a persistent issue, especially during the winter months. Poor air quality in the region is often exacerbated by factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and weather conditions that trap pollutants close to the ground. By encouraging drivers to turn off their engines while waiting at red lights, the campaign aims to reduce unnecessary idling and emissions, thus contributing to improved air quality. It also raises awareness about the need for collective action to combat air pollution. Air quality concerns in Delhi have led to various measures, including restrictions on industrial activities, vehicular usage, and the promotion of cleaner transportation alternatives. The return of the 'Red light on, gaadi off' campaign is another step toward addressing the pressing issue of air pollution in the city and protecting the health of its residents."

    "reference": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued various dietary recommendations and guidelines aimed at promoting healthier eating habits and reducing the global burden of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes. These recommendations often emphasize the importance of reducing the consumption of certain ingredients like sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats. While these guidelines are well-intentioned and aim to address the rising health concerns worldwide, some argue that they could unintentionally categorize traditional Indian food products as unhealthy. Indian cuisine is renowned for its diversity, incorporating a wide range of ingredients, flavors, and cooking techniques. Many traditional Indian foods are rich in spices, herbs, and whole ingredients, and they play a significant role in the country's cultural and culinary heritage. However, some of these traditional dishes can be high in fat, salt, or sugar, which aligns with the areas that WHO guidelines often target. Critics argue that a one-size-fits-all approach to dietary recommendations may not account for the nuances of different cuisines and dietary practices. They believe that recommendations need to consider the diversity of diets worldwide and respect cultural and traditional aspects. Balancing the promotion of healthier eating habits while respecting cultural and traditional foods is a complex challenge. Many experts advocate for a more nuanced approach that appreciates the health benefits of traditional cuisines while offering practical recommendations for moderation and balanced diets. These discussions highlight the importance of addressing global health concerns while respecting cultural diversity and traditional culinary practices."

    "prediction": "You may have been times in your lives where you have felt alone at your home despite family members being around you. Have you ever thought about this? Why is this happening? This could be because you are feeling disconnected with those around you. They are not able to understand you, your ideas and more importantly where are you coming from. Despite repeated attempts of making they know how you feel about certain things, everything remains the same and no changes are happening. Over a period of time, when you notice things are not changing and in spite of your repeated efforts nothing is being worked out, a sense of disassociation starts",
    "reference": "Loneliness is not solely a result of physical isolation; it can also emerge in the presence of others. The feeling of being alone, even when surrounded by people, is often associated with the quality of interpersonal relationships and emotional connections. It's not their mere physical absence but the absence of meaningful, supportive, and fulfilling interactions that can lead to a sense of isolation. Several factors contribute to this paradoxical loneliness: 1. Superficial Interactions: When conversations and interactions with those around you lack depth and authenticity, it can create a sense of detachment and solitude. 2. Miscommunication: Poor communication and misunderstandings can hinder the formation of genuine connections, making you feel isolated in a crowd. 3. Emotional Disconnect: Loneliness can stem from a lack of emotional intimacy and support in relationships. If you can't share your thoughts and feelings, the people around you might inadvertently contribute to your loneliness. 4. Conflict and Tension: Ongoing conflicts within the household can strain relationships, leading to a palpable sense of isolation. 5. Misaligned Interests: When your interests and values don't align with those of the people you're surrounded by, it can exacerbate feelings of being out of place. Addressing loneliness in the presence of others involves nurturing meaningful relationships, fostering open and empathetic communication, and actively seeking connections that fulfill your emotional needs. Sometimes, the support of a therapist or counselor may be necessary to explore the root causes of loneliness and develop strategies for overcoming it. Loneliness is a complex and common human experience, and acknowledging and addressing it is essential for emotional well-being."

While they have been utilized by politicians to showcase their dissatisfaction with the ruling government, the impact on the general population is often severe. Whether it's political protests, labor strikes, or other forms of shutdowns, these actions lead to widespread economic losses, inconvenience, and even violence. India lost 11.73 lakh man-days to strikes in 2017, costing the nation Rs 1,4350 crores, according to the Labour Bureau. Despite attempts by the highest court to curtail these practices, they persist. A recent survey showed that the majority of people are against bandhs, believe they're orchestrated for personal gain, and favor legal bans and punishment for those responsible. While bandhs might serve as a means of expression for political grievances, their utility and public acceptance are dwindling. It's high time to reconsider the impact of these disruptive tactics on a democratic society and explore more constructive means of addressing concerns and dissent."

Director Prakash Jha rightfully challenged the ban before the Supreme Court of India, arguing against curbing democratic freedoms. The ban contradicts the constitutional right to freedom of speech (Article 19(1)(a)), with permissible restrictions clearly defined by the Supreme Court. Political and communal pressure groups should not dictate what movies people can watch; such actions endanger democracy. In the case of \"Aarakshan,\" objections focus on minor elements rather than the film's core. Banning it disregards the democratic process of open discussion and expression. Allowing the film to screen uncut, as certified by the Central Board of Film Certification, is essential to preserve India's status as a free and open society, safeguarding a fundamental aspect of the Indian Constitution."

Bunn and Thomas Netter, who worked at the World Health Organization, gaining official approval in 1988. World AIDS Day serves as a global opportunity to refocus and bolster efforts against HIV/AIDS while fostering support for people living with the virus. Addressing the complexities of HIV/AIDS, which not only affect physical and medical aspects but also psychological, social, and economic dimensions, requires unified and sustainable policies and programs. HIV/AIDS prevention must be mainstreamed through governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the community to mitigate vulnerabilities, especially in regions like Arunachal Pradesh, which shares borders with high HIV-prevalence neighboring states. The state's campaign focuses on multimedia awareness, advocacy meetings, rallies, and various activities to mark World AIDS Day, engaging schools, colleges, government departments, and local organizations."

    "reference": "Twenty-three years ago, Robin Jeffrey, a professor of politics at Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe University, had described Ramnath Goenka\u2019s \u201cIndian Express empire\u201d as the \u201cgrandest version of newspapers with some link to the \u2018freedom struggle\u2019\u201d in his book. When Goenka died in 1991, Jeffrey wrote in India\u2019s Newspaper Revolution: Capitalism, Politics and the Indian-Language Press (1977-99) that \u201chis newspapers were published in cities and towns in every region of India except Calcutta and the east.\u201d But the Indian Express was not started by Goenka. It was started in 1932 by Varadarajulu Naidu, an ayurvedic doctor and Congressman. According to Warrior of the Fourth Estate by BG Verghese, the newspaper was priced at one anna and published by Naidu\u2019s Tamil Nadu press. In the first issue on September 5, 1932, the front page was solely devoted to seven display advertisements and the masthead was ornate with a crest resembling a coat of arms inscribed with a Tamil motto. While the book doesn\u2019t say what that motto was, it does give us the credo Naidu declared in the first editorial of this fledgling newspaper: \u201cOwing no allegiance to any political party in the country, it will stand staunchly for freedom in all national spheres of activity. Non-communal in outlook, it will advocate justice to all communities in political, social and economic life with a view to welding all of them into a great Indian Nation.\u201d But running a daily newspaper even then was no easy feat. Verghese writes, within weeks, Naidu was in financial trouble and sold the paper to Swaminathan Sadanand, who had founded nationalist news agency Free Press Service and would later start Free Press Journal. A year later, with Ramnath Goenka\u2019s support, the Express opened an office in Madurai and launched a sister paper in Tamil, Dinamani. Sadanand too began struggling. That\u2019s when Goenka stepped in, bailing Sadanand out by buying debentures worth Rs 30,000. Yet, financial difficulties persisted. Dinamani came under government scrutiny and Free Press Service collapsed in 1935. So, on October 1, 1936, Publicity Madras Ltd was floated with Goenka as managing director holding 51 percent shares. Sadanand held the balance. The book says that C Rajagopalachari, premier of the Madras presidency in the late 1930s, had urged Goenka to rescue and rebuild Indian Express, but Sadanand fought to regain control. Relations strained and a legal battle ensued. Meanwhile, Sadanand introduced several innovations and reduced the newspaper\u2019s price. Goenka finally reached out to Jamnalal Bajaj for financial help to buy Sadanand\u2019s stake. Bajaj did help, but the book says it can\u2019t be ascertained how he helped. It also doesn\u2019t confirm whether this was when Indian Express\u2019s complete buyout by Goenka took place. But Verghese writes that although Sadanand and Goenka \u201cparted company over control of the Indian Express in Madras, they remained close friends and had mutual regard for one another\u201d. Ramnath Goenka: Bania from Bihar to a national media baron Goenka was born in 1904 to a Rajasthani bania family in Bihar. He was six months old when his mother died and was adopted by his paternal uncle\u2019s widow. Verghese writes that Goenka got little formal schooling in Darbhanga and Janakpur in Nepal. At the age of 12, he was married to 10-year-old Moongi Bai with whom he later had three children: Bhagwandas, Krishna and Radha. While the book is unable to explain why Goenka had to leave studies early, it determines that Goenka was 16 when he joined his adopted mother\u2019s merchant brothers in Calcutta. He also apprenticed with an established yarn and piece goods dealer. During the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, apparently Goenka too was rounded up for joining a protest against the Rowlatt Act. Verghese guesses the Marwari community would have been alarmed \u2013 politics and business didn\u2019t mix, after all \u2013 and sent him away to distant Madras. This may have sowed the seeds of nationalism in Goenka\u2019s heart, later inspiring him to enter the media and use it to carry the torch of nationhood throughout his life."

As I have mentioned before , it will be like Brexit not because a policy two or three quarters from today is going to be worse, it is just the uncertainty. You just do not know what can happen in terms of policy and what he will do and that alone will take the market down. But what would be the immediate market reaction in these three scenarios: if Clinton wins with a slim majority; if Clinton wins with an absolute majority which is more than 300 seats or if Trump wins?",
    "reference": "The impact of the US presidential election on the markets and emerging markets, including India, is being closely watched. If Hillary Clinton wins, markets are likely to react positively, with some expectations of a modest rally. However, a Trump win could lead to an initial negative market reaction due to the uncertainty surrounding his policies. Emerging markets may also underperform if Trump wins, as his anti-trade policies are seen as negative for these markets. Longer term, some of Trump's policies may have a positive impact on the US economy."

The IMF expects global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 percent, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression. This projection is based on the assumption that the pandemic peaks in the second quarter for most countries and recedes in the second half of the year. If this assumption does not hold, the economic impact could be even more severe. In the event that the pandemic continues into 2021, global GDP may fall by an additional 8 percent compared to the baseline scenario. The report also highlights the need for international cooperation, supportive fiscal and monetary policies, and measures to ensure that developing countries have access to financing and relief. The IMF is actively deploying its lending capacity to support vulnerable countries and is calling on official bilateral creditors to do the same. The report acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the duration and intensity of the health crisis and emphasizes the importance of global efforts to provide immediate access to therapies and vaccines.

India's government sees these demands as trivial and not addressing the serious issues raised in the dossier. Pakistan's response is seen as a reluctance to take credible action against JeM terrorists operating on its soil, and India had provided specific and actionable inputs about JeM's involvement in the attack.

India had requested Pakistan's assistance in identifying an individual who claimed Jaish's responsibility for the attack, and Pakistan asked for more information about his identity.

Acquiring qualifications on paper is not enough; individuals must be highly competent and passionate about their chosen field. Encouraging and promoting individual initiatives is crucial. Social Level: Unemployment is not only an individual problem but a collective issue that affects society as a whole. The author suggests that societies should work together to explore various possibilities for employment generation. Cooperative societies could provide support to budding entrepreneurs, especially in financial matters. Educational Level: The author emphasizes the importance of addressing unemployment at the grassroots level in educational institutions. Combining intellectual pursuits with activity-oriented learning can better prepare students for the job market. Vocational education and specialized courses should be integrated into the curriculum to offer a wider range of employment opportunities. The author concludes by stressing the need for self-reflection and action at the individual and societal levels.

Earlier, the Russian authorities banned the construction of an ISKCON community village in the Tomsk region and did not allow the movement to build a large prayer-cum-cultural complex in central Moscow. The Russian ambassador to India, Alexander Kadakin, expressed regret that the case was being heard in Tomsk, a city known for its secularism and religious tolerance, and reiterated Russia's secular credentials. He emphasized that it was not normal for religious texts to be taken to courts and that such scrutiny should be done at academic forums rather than in a legal setting. He also praised the Bhagavad Gita as a great source of wisdom for people in India and around the world."

    "reference": "An economics researcher from Griffith University, Dr. Nicholas Rohde, claims to have settled the debate about the greatest Test batsman ever by picking Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar over late Australian legend Sir Donald Bradman. Using economic theory, Dr. Rohde compared batsmen from different eras and concluded that Tendulkar is the premier Test batsman in history. Tendulkar holds the world record for the most runs in Test cricket, with 15,183 runs from 184 Tests at an average of 56.02. Bradman played 52 Tests from 1928 to 1948 and scored 6,996 runs at an average of 99.94. The rankings by Dr. Rohde are designed to allow meaningful comparisons of players with careers of different lengths. Theoretical analysis puts Tendulkar above Bradman in these rankings, although it is noted that their positions could change over time due to fluctuations in form."

These appointments were made by the department's then-director, B. P. Sinha, in 1985-86. The decision to investigate came after the Department of Vigilance failed to provide essential documents related to the appointments. Additionally, principals of various polytechnics in Bihar are implicated in the case for failing to verify appointment letters before allowing the selected candidates to join their positions. This issue has lingered since an FIR was filed in 1994, and the CBI is now tasked with conducting a thorough inquiry. In a related case, a former associate professor from Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital, Dr. Gagandeo Narain Singh, had his bail petition rejected by a single bench, presided over by Justice Narayan Roy. Dr. Singh was caught red-handed by vigilance officers while accepting a bribe of Rs. 1 lakh from a postgraduate medical student (MS - ENT examinee). The doctor had demanded the bribe from the student, promising him the first position and a gold medal. The vigilance department promptly laid a trap, leading to Dr. Singh's arrest. His servant, Upendra Rai, who received the bribe, also had his bail petition rejected."

Approximately 70% of the Kharif crops, valued at Rs 1,865 crore, have been damaged, and the availability of fodder is expected to cover only half of the required supply this year. Dam water levels have fallen below 25% in various areas across the state. This request for Rs 100 crore is just the initial step, as more funds may be required. The government's strategy involves prioritizing drinking water, followed by agricultural needs, and lastly industrial needs. Despite recent rainfall in the Marathwada region, the situation remains critical, and the impact on the kharif crop is irreversible. The state is contemplating redirecting funds from its annual plan to address the crisis, which has worsened due to last year's drought and the excessive strain on the state's finances."

On Wednesday a number of candidates held a demonstration before the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) office alleging irregularities in the results.

The controversy took a political overtone after former Chief Minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) patron Jitan Ram Manjhi alleged discrepancies in the results published by the BPSC. Manjhi's HAM is now a part of the NDA.

FPJ Web DeskUpdated: Wednesday, October 25, 2023, 08:26 PM IST article-image India has opted to reinstate visa services for specific categories of Canadian citizens, encompassing Entry Visa, Business Visa, Medical Visa, and Conference Visa. This decision comes after a recent suspension of visa services to Canadians, which occurred in the midst of escalating diplomatic tensions between India and Canada. The Indian High Commission of India in Canada, in a notification on Wednesday, said, \"After a considered review of the security situation that takes into account some recent Canadian measures in this regard, it has been decided to resume visa services.\" The reinstatement of visa services will take effect on Thursday, October 26. On Sunday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that if Indian diplomats are guaranteed safety in Canada in accordance with the Vienna Convention, he would \"very much like to resume visa issuance.\" He explained that India had halted visa issuance in Canada due to concerns about the safety of our diplomats while carrying out their duties. India suspended the issuance of new visas to Canadians in September after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asserted having \"credible\" allegations of potential involvement of Indian government agents in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Trudeau alleged that his country's national security officials had grounds to suspect that the murder was carried out by \"agents of the Indian government.\" In response to Canada's claims, India labeled them as \"absurd\" and \"politically motivated.\""

The Iranian regime views China as a potential ally against the United States, and Beijing views Iran as a potential partner for limiting U.S. influence in the Middle East. China has remained Iran\u2019s largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years as of 2022, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. China-Iran trade totaled USD 15.8 billion in 2022, up 7 percent year-on-year. In 2021, China agreed to invest between USD 400 to USD 600 billion in Iran over the next 25 years. In the field of transportation alone, China is going to invest USD 12 billion, which includes projects like the high-speed rail link between Tehran and Mashhad, and investment in the Imam Khomeini Airport City. China\u2019s crude oil imports from Iran reportedly set a new record in December 2022. China\u2019s economic ties to Iran have shielded the Iranian regime from the effects of international sanctions. Over the past several years, China has become Iran\u2019s number one oil customer and trading partner. China has saved roughly USD 4.2 billion by importing a record 1 million bpd from Iran from January 2023 to September 2023, 60 percent above pre-sanction peaks recorded by Chinese customs in 2017 at 623,000 bpd, as Tehran raised output to near-maximum levels and offered discounts as steep as USD 17 a barrel versus Brent. In March 2023, China brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties seven years after severing relations. The deal reflected Beijing\u2019s growing influence and interest in Iran and in the Middle East. China has aided Iran\u2019s efforts to modernize its military hardware and doctrine through the transfer of military technology and sales of small arms and tactical ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles. China has also assisted in the development of Iran\u2019s nuclear program through the transfer of technology and machinery. In August 2023, Iran became the newest member of the SCO, joining China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. This grants Iran a freer hand to openly trade arms with Russia, China, and other SCO countries, which will result in Iran\u2019s expanding its influence and aggression in the region. Fighting and tension between Israel \u2013 Palestine in the West Bank, and Israel \u2013 Hamas in Gaza helped advance Iran\u2019s aim of undermining US and Israel ties with Iran\u2019s rivals in the Middle East region \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. With the Abraham Accords, the United States under former US President Donald Trump scored a major diplomatic victory in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to have diplomatic relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia and Israel were to strengthen their diplomatic relations in keeping with the Abraham Accords but the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has put those plans on ice. China to counter the influence of the United States in the Middle East impressed upon Iran to restore diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. China through Iran may have encouraged Hamas to attack Israel. Hamas gains considerably from Iran\u2019s provision of weapons, technology, training, and financing of terror operations. This support allows Hamas to carry out attacks against Israel. Iran sees Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, as crucial centers of power in the Palestinian arena and uses these terror organizations to further its agenda against Israel. Since the Gaza-Israel conflict escalated on October 7, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that the question of Palestine needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only way to solve the question. Only when the \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d is fully implemented in the Middle East can real peace be ushered in. In fact, China\u2019s position on the Palestinian concerns has been consistent. China backs the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on relevant United Nations documents and resolves the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through peaceful negotiations. China does not directly work with Hamas, but it uses Iran to work with Hamas. Iran provides financial aid, weapons, training, and technological support to Hamas. The Israel-Hamas war will see more of China\u2019s engagement in the Middle East. China is expected to play an enhanced role in efforts to end the war and secure its economic interests and wants to capitalize on the Arab states\u2019 frustration with the U.S. to establish itself as a great power in the region. Middle-East is crucial to China\u2019s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) for its energy exports and over the years China has been deepening its economic cooperation with Middle-Eastern countries. Chinese investments and construction projects in two of the most prominent Arab nations \u2013 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have totaled USD 97 billion. China has pursued a proactive foreign policy and it is looking at its investments in the railways, roads, seaports, and airports as an extension of its influence in the Middle East. The Chinese government has always propagated a narrative on the Israel-Palestine conflict that places the blame on Israel. That is because Israel is a close ally of the US and it is the objective of the CCP to undermine the United States government in the international geopolitical community. The Israel-Hamas war has put on hold the peace talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. China has ensured through Iran and Hamas that the Middle East region remains in a state of war. For China, the crisis is a chance to establish itself as a kingmaker in the Middle East, win ground from the United State and strengthen partnerships with Russia and across the Arab world. China has got Iran to use its pet Hamas well."

    "prediction": "Glenn Maxwell's century and David Warner's 104 helped Australia to a mammoth total of 399/8.",
    "reference": "NEW DELHI, OCTOBER 25 (IANS): After Glenn Maxwell and David Warner's brilliant show with bat, Australia's Adam Zampa spun a web around the Netherlands' batter as Australia achieved the biggest victory in WC history - 309 runs in the 24th match of the ongoing ICC World Cup, here on Wednesday. Zampa scalped four wickets, while Mitchell Marsh took two to bundle the Netherlands out for just 90 in 21 overs at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazelwood and Pat Cummins also managed to take one wicket each. The five-time champions earned two points, and got a massive NRR boost, and are once again on course for a spot in the semis if they continue this way. A target of 400 was always going to be daunting and fans wanted to see how Netherlands would respond to the target. However, it turned out to be a disappointment. The wickets just kept tumbling, and Zampa ran through the tail. Zampa now has the most wickets at the 2023 WC with 13 wickets. Vikramjit Singh (25) was the highest scorer for the Netherlands. Earlier, Maxwell scored the fastest century (106 off 44 balls) of the World Cup to guide Australia to a mammoth 399/8. Maxwell reached one of the most entertaining ODI centuries of all time in just 40 balls, breaking the previous record held by Adien Marken (in 48 balls) at the same ground. Maxi smashed the Netherlands' bowlers in all parts of the stadium. And he was given a standing ovation by the crowd for his thrilling innings .Meanwhile, David Warner, too, hit an impressive 104 runs off 93 balls. Warner made the ton more iconic by celebrating it in his famous \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPushpa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 style at the almost packed stadium. It was his 6th ODI World Cup ton. After deciding to bat first, Australia didn't get the kind of start they thought of as Mitchell Marsh (9) lost his wicket to Logan van Beek in the fourth over. From there, Warner and Steven Smith (71) built up a solid 132 runs partnership to put Aussies on the drivers' spot. Both the batters played some brilliant shots to entertain the cricket fanatics present in the stadium. However, Aryan Dutt dismissed Smith to break the partnership. M Labuschagne (62) then joined hands with the opener batter to frustrate the Netherlands bowlers. The duo stitched 84-runs together. At 244, Australia lost Labuschagne. Next batter Josh Inglis (14) also failed to spend time on crease as he was sent back early by Bas de Leede. Soon after that, Warner also got out by Logan Van Beek. But from there Maxwell changed the gear and entertained the cricket fanatics with some brilliant eye-catching shots all over the ground."

    "reference": "CHANGLANG, 24 Oct: In a shocking development, the presence \u2013 or rather, the absence \u2013 of ghost staffers has surfaced in the education department in Changlang district.

He further pointed out that \u201cthere is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.\u201d It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC\u2019s directive to submit the report. It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar. Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte\u2019s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE. Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries. It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries. \u201cTheir presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?\u201d asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,\u201d he said. It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye\u2019s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him. When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. \u201cIf the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,\u201d Tak said. The vigilance department is currently investigating illegal appointment of PRTs, TGTs, UDCs, LDCs and MTS staffers in the education department."

    "prediction": "India pharma industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7 % over the next five years.",
    "reference": "Dr Manisha Verma Government of India has recently launched the National Policy on Research and Development (R&D) and Innovation in Pharma-MedTech Sector and the Scheme for promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector (PRIP). Let us learn more about this Policy-what are its salient features and in what manner will it lead to strengthening the R&D in the pharma sector. Indian Pharmaceutical sector The Indian pharmaceutical industry is widely recognised as \u2018Pharmacy of the World\u2019. It is the 3rd largest pharmaceutical industry by volume with current market size of around USD 50 Billions. The industry could potentially grow to USD 120-130 Billion(? 9,84,000 to ? 10,66,000 crores) over the next decade, increasing its contribution to GDP by about 100 basis points. India is one of the biggest global suppliers of low-cost vaccines. 60 % of global vaccines are produced in India. India is a global leader in supply of DPT, BCG and Measles vaccines. We contribute upto 70 % of the WHO demand for Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis (DPT) and Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccines, and 90% of WHO demand for the measles vaccine. India is also the largest provider of generic medicines globally, occupying a 20% share in global supply by volume. The industry manufactures about 60,000 different generic brands across 60 therapeutic categories. India exports Pharmaceuticals to over 200 countries. Over 50% of Africa\u2019s requirement for generics, nearly 40% of generic demand in the US and approximately 25% of all medicine in the UK is supplied by India. Additionally, we have the highest number of US-FDA compliant Pharma plants outside of USA. India is home to more than 3,000 pharma companies with a strong network of over 10,500 manufacturing facilities as well as a highly skilled resource pool. Major segments of the Pharmaceutical Industry include generic drugs, bulk drugs, vaccines, Over-The-Counter (OTC) medicines, biosimilars and biologics. There are 500 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturers contributing about 8% in the global API Industry. As per the FICCI Report on Indian pharma industry (2021), India\u2019s pharma industry has demonstrated a compounded growth rate of (CAGR) of about 11% in the domestic market, while the exports have registered a 16% growth over the last two decades. The domestic market has grown at a pace similar to the gross domestic product (GDP); the overall growth is reportedly driven by the industry\u2019s remarkable steps in supplying generic formulations to global markets. India\u2019s pharmaceutical sector is a major contributor to the country\u2019s foreign trade and the trade surplus. During 2022-23, total pharmaceuticalexports were pegged at USD 25.26 Bn. Apart from this, the Pharmaceutical sector is a favourite destination for foreign investors, and has emerged as one of the top ten attractive sectors for foreign investment in India. It accounts for about 3.3% of total Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in the country across various sectors.100% FDI in the pharmaceutical sector is allowed under the automatic route for greenfield pharmaceuticals. Wherein 74% is allowed under the automatic route and thereafter through the Govt approval route. Importance of R&D, and Innovation in pharmaceuticals The global pharma sector has grown by leaps and bounds in the past decade. A significant role is played by enhanced research and innovation. Cutting edge insights and innovations in various clinical and non-clinical aspects have driven the worldwide growth. Sustainable and continued research is found to be important to fulfil growing and unmet needs and add value to the pharma sector. The speed of innovations in the post-COVID era is observed to be much faster, and covers various un-chartered arena. \u2018Big data and analytics\u2019 is poised to play a big role, while technology is seen to drive the newer advancements in the sector. Machine learning, AI-powered drugs discovery, personalised medicines along with digital personal connect with patients, gadget driven treatment regimes, larger role of medical devices, nano drug driven clinical solutions are predicted to provide a competitive edge to manufacturers and drive massive outcomes. Drug re-purposing is another innovation that will underpin a shift in the pharmaceutical market. Re-purposed drugs were seen during COVID times too.In addition to this, innovative thinking to encourage private investments, and to explore newer funding avenues for high risk / long term projects have often been discussed. Augmenting industry-academia collaboration and to establish a strong research and innovation ecosystem, developing innovative models for improving drug affordability as an alternative to price capping, upgrading the manufacturing facilities and supply chain infrastructure with technology, automation and digital interventions to improve efficiencies have also been flagged as critical pillars to provide impetus for a strong growth in the sector. Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi stated that India\u2019s pharma industry is an \u201casset for the entire world\u201d (July 2020). He further highlighted that \u201cvaccines made in India are responsible for two-thirds of the vaccine needs of the world\u2019s children\u201d. He has acknowledged the importance of research and innovation as critical components for New India. In his speech from the ramparts of Red Fort on India\u2019s 76th Independence Day, he said- \u201cNow, there is another necessity to add, Jai Anusandhan (research and innovation). Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyaanaur Jai Anusandhan.\u201d There is immense ground to be covered by India in R&D in various sectors. NITI Aayog has flagged India\u2019s lagging position vis-\u00e0-vis other countries in this regard. With an eye on the ample opportunities that can be explored and captured, the Parliament recently approved the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Bill, 2023, which provides for establishing the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF). NRF will be the apex national body to provide strategic direction for research, innovation, and entrepreneurship in the fields of: (i) natural sciences including mathematics, (ii) engineering and technology, (iii) environmental and earth sciences, (iv) health and agriculture, and (v) scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences. Recognising the importance of and need for research and innovation in the pharma sector, and based on recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee in its 46th Report, Department of Pharmaceuticals, Government of Indiaconstituted a high level inter- departmental committee to draft and finalize Policy on R&D and Innovation in pharmaceuticals & medical devices sectors. It submitted its report in September, 2020.Based on the suggestions, the \u2018Policy to Catalyse R&D and Innovation in the Pharma MedTech Sector in India\u2019 has been prepared to encourage R&D in pharmaceuticals and medical devices and to create an ecosystem for innovation in the sector in order for India to become leader in drug discovery and innovative medical devices through incubating an entrepreneurial environment. The Policy has been notified in gazette on 18th August, 2023. The Policy focus is on three areas: 1. To create a regulatory environment that facilitates innovation and research in product development, expanding the traditional regulatory objectives of safety and quality. 2. To incentivize private and public investment in innovation through a mix of fiscal and non-fiscal measures. 3. To build an enabling ecosystem designed to support innovation and cross-sectoral research as a strong institutional foundation for sustainable growth in the sector. Implementation of provisions of the Policy is expected to result in increased drug security and availability;improvement of overall healthcare index and reduced disease burden; higher contribution in the GDP; increased exports and forex inflow; increase in global market share; creation of high-end jobs in R&D and Innovation and opportunity to attract Indian talent with expertise in R&D and Innovation. PRIP (Promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector) At present a major component of Indian exports are low value generic drugs while a large proportion of the demand for patented drugs is met through imports. This is because the Indian Pharmaceutical sector still has much ground to cover in high value production and instil global pharma R&D. In order to incentivize the global and domestic players to enhance investment and production in these product categories, a well-designed and suitably targeted intervention is required to give impetus to specific high value goods such as biopharmaceuticals, complex generic drugs, patented drugs or drugs nearing patent expiry, cell based or gene therapy drugs. The medical device sector also forms an essential and integral constituent of the healthcare sector, and any innovation in pharma sector needs to cover this category too. In view of the above, Department of Pharmaceutical has recentlyunveiled the PRIP (Promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector) scheme with a budget outlay of Rs. 5000 crores. It was notified in the Gazette on 17th August 2023. The objective of the scheme is to transform Indian pharmaceuticals sector from cost-based to innovation-based growth by strengthening the research infrastructure in the country. The scheme aims to promote industry-academia linkage for R&D in priority areas and to inculcate the culture of quality research and nurture the pool of scientists. This is expected to lead to sustained global competitive advantage and contribute to quality employment generation in the country. The scheme has two components- 1. Strengthening the research infrastructure by establishment of sevenCentersof Excellence(CoE) at National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER). These CoEs would be set up in pre identified areas with a financial outlay of Rs. 700 Crores. 2. Promoting research in pharmaceutical sector by encouraging research in six priority areas like new chemical entities, complex generics including biosimilars, medical devices, stem cell therapy, orphan drugs, anti-microbial resistance etc., wherein financial assistance will be provided for the industries, MSME, SME, startups working with government institutes and for both in- house and academic research. The component has a financial outlay of Rs.4,250 Crores. The following benefits are being envisaged- 1. Development of research infrastructure- The scheme would help in building a world class research atmosphere at NIPERs and other institutes and help in creating talent pool of qualified trained students. 2. This scheme will promote industry-academia linkages by promoting collaboration between private sector and government institutes. 3. Focus on certain priority areas which will help India\u2019s pharma industry leapfrog and radically strengthen its position in the world market as innovation accounts for 2/3rd of global pharmaceutical opportunities. https://www.thesangaiexpress.com/Encyc/2023/10/25/Dr-Manisha-VermaGovernment-of-India-has-recently-launched-the-National-Policy-on-Research-and-Development-R.html"

The development comes in the wake of rampant illegal appointments made in the department across the state. Changlang DC Sunny K Singh issued an order on 20 October, stating that \u201csome ghost staffers have been detected in the education department who are drawing salaries without physical presence.\u201d Stating that there is a possibility of similar ghost staffers\u2019 \u2018presence\u2019 in other departments also, Singh further directed all heads of departments in the district to \u201cverify the status and submit a certificate that all employees of their respective departments exist on the ground.\u201d The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to \u201cverify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.\u201d \u201cIt has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,\u201d the DC stated. He further pointed out that \u201cthere is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.\u201d It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC\u2019s directive to submit the report. It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar. Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte\u2019s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE. Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries. It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries. \u201cTheir presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?\u201d asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,\u201d he said. It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye\u2019s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him. When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. \u201cIf the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,\u201d Tak said."

New York: Amazon is rolling out an independent cloud for Europe as it looks to address strict regulations that companies and those in the public sector face in the European Union. Amazon Web Services said on Wednesday that its AWS European Sovereign Cloud, which will be located in and operate out of Europe, will have the same security, availability, and performance as existing AWS regions but will be separate from them. The cloud will let customers keep all metadata they create in the European Union and will have its own billing and usage metering systems. \u201cThe AWS European Sovereign Cloud reinforces our commitment to offering AWS customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls, privacy safeguards, and security features available in the cloud,\u201d Max Peterson, vice president of Sovereign Cloud at AWS, said in a written statement. Transatlantic data protection has been a growing concern since the European Union's top court struck down a data sharing agreement in 2020 known as Privacy Shield. ADVERTISEMENT The court said at the time that the agreement, which allowed businesses to transfer data to the US under the EU's strict data privacy rules, was invalid because it didn't go far enough to prevent the American government from snooping on user data. In 2021 Microsoft said that it would let business and public sector customers in the European Union keep cloud computing data inside the 27-nation bloc to avert concerns about US government access to sensitive information. Amazon's AWS supports 143 security standards and compliance certifications, to help customers meet regulatory requirements. ADVERTISEMENT The company said that AWS is collaborating with European regulators and national cybersecurity agencies to build the AWS European Sovereign Cloud so that it is able to meet additional data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs in Europe. Germany will be the first AWS Region within the AWS European Sovereign Cloud and will be available to all European customers. Only EU-resident AWS employees who are located in the EU will have control of the operations and support for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. \"The development of a European AWS cloud will make it much easier for many public sector organisations and companies with high data security and data protection requirements to use AWS services,\u201d Claudia Plattner, president of the German Federal Office for Information Security, said. AWS infrastructure in Europe currently includes eight regions in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, Spain, and Zurich. The company plans to launch five more AWS regions in Canada, Germany, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. https://www.thehansindia.com/technology/tech-news/samsung-launches-galaxy-smarttag2-in-india-832369?infinitescroll=1"

    "reference": "Israeli troops and tanks launched a brief ground raid into northern Gaza overnight into Thursday, the military said, striking several militant targets in order to \u201cprepare the battlefield\" ahead of a widely expected ground invasion after more than two weeks of devastating air raids. The raid came after the UN warned it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory, which has also been under a complete siege since Hamas' bloody rampage across southern Israel ignited the war earlier this month. Hospitals in Gaza struggled to treat masses of wounded with dwindling resources. Health officials said the death toll was soaring as Israeli jets pounded Gaza. Workers pulled dead and wounded civilians, including many children, out of landscapes of rubble in cities across the territory. Gaza's Health Ministry, which is controlled by Hamas, said Wednesday that more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours, higher than the 704 killed the previous day. The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll, and the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The Israeli military, which accuses Hamas of operating among civilians, said its strikes killed militants and destroyed military targets. Gaza militants have fired unrelenting rocket barrages into Israel since the conflict started. During the overnight raid, the military said soldiers struck fighters, militant infrastructure and anti-tank missile launching positions. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either aide. The rising death tolls in Gaza are unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in the war. That figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza. The warning by the U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen. Gaza's population has also been running out of food, water and medicine. About 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowded into U.N. Shelters. Hamas' surprise rampage on Oct. 7 in southern Israel stunned the country with its brutality, its unprecedented toll and the failure of intelligence agencies to know it was coming. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Wednesday night that he will be held accountable, but only after Hamas was defeated."

This widening of the trading band, up from the previous limit of 0.5 percent, aims to better reflect market supply and demand, promote the exchange of the Renminbi, enhance the yuan's flexibility in two-way fluctuations, and improve the market-based managed floating exchange rate regime linked to a basket of foreign currencies, according to the PBOC. The move is in line with China's efforts to align its currency policies with market dynamics."

The decision was made after a meeting between coup leaders and leaders of 22 opposition parties. Two committees have been formed to handle diplomatic affairs and social issues until the transitional council is established. The West African bloc ECOWAS has condemned the coup and called for a return to constitutional rule, urging a resumption of the disrupted presidential election scheduled between former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Junior and ex-President Kumba Yala. However, even before the coup, opposition leaders, including Yala, had denounced the election's first-round result as fraudulent and had called for a boycott. The junta claims to have detained Gomes, Yala, and Army Chief-of-Staff General Antonio Indjai, although some observers suspect General Indjai's involvement in the coup."

Sushil, aged 29 at the time, faced a formidable challenge in Yonemitsu, ultimately losing by a score of 3-1.Sushil Kumar had previously won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, and his journey to the final in London was remarkable. His efforts were celebrated as he aimed to upgrade his Olympic medal to gold, but he fell short in the final match. Nevertheless, Sushil's achievement of securing consecutive Olympic medals was a significant milestone for Indian wrestling and a source of pride for the nation. Though the gold medal eluded him on this occasion, his dedication and accomplishments in the sport continued to inspire aspiring wrestlers in India."

    "reference": "In New Delhi's futures trading market, crude palm oil prices extended their decline for the second consecutive day, falling by Rs 3 per 10 kg. This decrease amounted to a 0.50% drop, with the April delivery futures settling at Rs 597 per 10 kg. The March delivery futures also saw a decline of Rs 1.70, or 0.29%, to reach Rs 591 per 10 kg. The decline in prices is attributed to sluggish demand in the spot market and an overabundance of palm oil stocks. The weakening of crude palm oil prices can be primarily attributed to the imbalance between supply and demand. With ample stocks on hand, the market is facing reduced buying interest, leading to the downward pressure on prices. These price fluctuations are closely monitored by traders and investors, as they are indicative of the current market conditions and can influence trading decisions in the commodities market."

It's been suggested that the Congress high command will delay any decision regarding Chavan's exit until after Obama's visit concludes on November 8. By then, a two-member committee comprising senior ministers Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony will have submitted their findings regarding the case. The Adarsh society scam involves the alleged illegal conversion of a prime property in Mumbai's Colaba area into a multi-crore housing society. While the examination of government files related to this issue is ongoing, the real challenge lies in making a political decision about Chavan's replacement. The dice seems loaded against Chavan, but political considerations and the timing of Obama's visit appear to have temporarily stalled any immediate action. Once the high-profile visit concludes, the fate of Chief Minister Chavan will likely be determined by the leadership's political judgment regarding the Adarsh society scandal."

People often migrate temporarily, but some, like Baban Singh, cannot leave their homes near the river. Floods disrupt education, sanitation, and clean water, leading to disease outbreaks. Historically, these floods enriched the land, but now they bring destruction. Local leaders seek more permanent solutions, using funds from government schemes for elevated housing. This year, rising river levels have put the region on high alert. Experts recommend comprehensive flood prevention measures, including drainage systems, watershed management, and river-linking projects to mitigate losses in both life and property."

Hardly 20% of the funds are made in equities, and, therefore, the funds invested by policyholders are absolutely safe. The total investment in the Adani group companies is \u20b936,474.78 crore, and the present market value stands at \u20b956,142 crore. Thus, LIC has earned a notional profit of \u20b920,000 crore on its investment in the Adani group. However, the profit is as notional as is the presumed loss. Every year, LIC generates an investible surplus of about \u20b94.5 lakh to \u20b95 lakh crore. In the case of the Adani group, the total exposure is only about 7% of the total equity investments done. In conclusion, the LIC has a strong track record of investing in secured instruments and generating profits. The exposure to the Adani group is relatively small, and the investments are safe."

This is because only the High Courts have the power to frame rules for the dress code of lawyers appearing before them or any subordinate courts or tribunals. The ruling came in response to a writ petition filed by advocate R. Rajesh, who challenged a notification issued by the Registrar of National Company Law Board in 2017 prescribing a dress code for lawyers. The petition argued that the notification was illegal since the NCLT had no authority to issue such instructions. The Division Bench of Justices R. Mahadevan and Mohammed Shaffiq agreed with the petitioner and quashed the 2017 notification. The judges held that tribunals cannot issue any instructions, directions or advisories which run contrary to the statutory rules and without there being any source of power to issue such instructions. The ruling is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the dress code of lawyers appearing before tribunals. It also reinforces the principle that tribunals cannot act beyond their jurisdiction."

    "reference": "The toll booth system has become problematic, leading to conflicts and delays, often escalating into tragic incidents. The introduction of FASTag hasn't fully addressed commuter convenience. To improve the situation, the author suggests replacing toll collection for private four-wheelers with a one-time lump sum fee, similar to Road Tax, paid during vehicle purchase. This approach eliminates congestion, reduces fuel consumption, and curtails pollution while fostering a more peaceful driving experience. It also offers economic advantages by saving on operational toll collection costs. Implementing a lump sum road tax is proposed as a transformative step towards a safer, more efficient, and economically thriving transportation system."

Notably, the requirement for government permission for worker retrenchment in factories employing 300 or more workers will be eliminated, up from the previous threshold of 100. Trade unions must now represent a minimum of 30% of workers to be officially recognized, up from the previous 15% requirement.

Over the past two years, systematic investment plans (SIPs) into mutual fund schemes have witnessed substantial growth. Fund houses are now receiving over Rs 61 crore in SIP investments every month, distributed across more than 3.15 lakh folios. This accounts for over 7 percent of the average monthly SIP investments of around Rs 800 crore that flow into 44 different asset management companies.

Laws exist, yet the absence of a precise definition of 'untouchability' leaves room for its pervasive presence. The struggle is not just legal but cultural, as societal norms enable the brazen intimidation of Dalits. Intangibles like faith resolve temple disputes, but the tangible issue of untouchability remains undefined. Judicial perspectives argue the complexity of defining untouchability, leading to its deliberate omission. Although abolished, the undefined practice persists, raising questions on its status and welfare measures linked to defining 'untouchables' as Scheduled Castes."

The use of GST data and measures to improve tax receipts have further contributed to this growth, with a significant rise in individual tax filings observed over the past decade.

The landmark judgement, which is approximately 10,000 pages long, was handed down by the three-judge panel comprising Justices SU Khan, Sudhir Agarwal, and Dharamveer Sharma. The contested site's 2.7 acres should be split into three equal pieces and handed to the Nirmohi Akhara, the Sunni Waqf Board, and the group defending Lord Ram. However, Justice D V Sharma determined that the disputed location is where Lord Ram was born and that the structure built by Mughal emperor Babur was contrary to Islamic beliefs and did not have the appearance of a mosque. The Bench ordered the site's current conditions to be maintained for a period of three months and requested recommendations from all parties about the delineation of the area. The justices also rejected the claims of the Nirmohi Akhara and the Sunni Central Waqf Board concerning the Babri Mosque on the grounds that they had expired or had become time-barred."

Despite ample resources, the eastern states\u2014Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, and Sikkim\u2014hold untapped agricultural potential needing focused development to boost productivity and prosperity."

Scientists estimated that around 2.06 tonnes of lunar epi-regolith were ejected and displaced over an area of 108.4 m\u00b2. To investigate the phenomenon, scientists used the Orbiter High-Resolution Camera aboard the Chandrayaan-2 orbiter, comparing high-resolution imagery before and after Vikram's landing.
