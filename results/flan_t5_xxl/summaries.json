As a result, the rupee hit an all-time low of 78.29 to the dollar on June 13, and market participants expect it to trade in the range of 79-80 to a dollar, possibly reaching 80 by the end of December. The impact on inflation is significant, as a weaker rupee is expected to worsen inflation. The Reserve Bank of India assumed that the rupee would trade around 76 per dollar during FY23 and noted that a 5% decline from this level would raise inflation by 20 basis points. For businesses, a weaker rupee means higher import costs, and Indian firms that have borrowed from the offshore dollar market will face increased interest repayments. The current account deficit (CAD) is also expected to worsen due to the weak rupee, especially at a time of heavy foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows. The CAD could reach 3% of GDP, compared to 1.2% in April-December 2021. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been intervening by selling dollars from its reserves to support the rupee. However, this approach has its limits, as depleting forex reserves at a rapid pace is not sustainable.

The study, published in Nature Medicine, found that mice genetically prone to breast cancer, when vaccinated with alpha-lactalbumin protein, didn't develop the cancer, unlike those given a placebo. The protein, not found in non-breast tissues, meets essential criteria for a preventive vaccine candidate. It's primarily present in lactating mothers, making it unlikely to harm non-lactating women. This development is a significant step in the quest for an effective breast cancer vaccine."

The committee also suggested that only the Supreme Court should decide on the constitutional validity of legislation passed by Parliament or state legislatures, with a minimum of seven judges and a two-thirds majority required for decisions. The committee pointed out that high courts had broader powers under Article 226 compared to the Supreme Court, which was limited to safeguarding fundamental rights.

One might have anticipated a continuation of this fiscal restraint, even though it was primarily achieved by curbing capital spending rather than reducing subsidies. However, in the latest budget presentation, the finance minister signaled an intention to increase public spending at a rate faster than the expected nominal economic growth. This shift from austerity to increased expenditure can be attributed to the upcoming national election scheduled for 2014.

During his three years as the country's leader, Vajpayee has demonstrated his capabilities and taken initiatives that have made him virtually irreplaceable. A significant milestone was his effort to initiate a dialogue with Pakistan, notably through the Agra summit, which paved the way for future discussions on a range of issues. His leadership and rapport with NDA components make him indispensable, akin to a father figure. He can withstand challenges and is known for being a good listener, which fosters trust among NDA members. It is incorrect to claim that he was imposed from the top or has failed to address differences within the NDA. The political landscape has evolved, and lessons have been learned from past experiments in forming non-Congress governments. The NDA was created with a national agenda for governance, transcending ideological differences and sectoral interests.

Last year, the hospital used its funding to pay salaries and NPA, but this year the government said they can't use the money for NPA. The doctors are really unhappy about this because the cost of living is high and petrol prices have gone up. They're asking for their full pay. The RIMS director said they're looking into it, but didn't give more details. Another group of doctors met with the principal secretary for health to talk about their concerns. They're giving the government 10 days to figure things out."

A Delhi High Court order prompted the board to invite the petitioner, Prashant Bhushan from the Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), to present his safety-related viewpoints on the project. Bhushan had previously accused two board members, Rakesh Chopra and Shri Prakash, of concealing safety risks associated with their preferred \"slope skirting alignment.\" Bhushan's PIL emphasized the need for a straighter, shorter alignment to mitigate landslide risks in the Himalayan terrain, as initially proposed by S.K. Vij in 2008 but later reversed by Chopra. The PIL criticized the board for failing to address fundamental alignment issues, causing significant delays in the project's completion. The Railway Board now faces scrutiny over its decision to retain the contentious alignment, despite earlier assurances regarding passenger safety made by Railway Minister Mamata Banerjee. The PIL argues that the board's actions have hindered the project's progress, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2007. While a portion of the project in the Kashmir valley has been completed, challenges associated with crossing the Himalayan terrain remain largely unresolved. The PIL contends that Chopra's involvement in the project's planning and execution during its initial stages influenced the board's decision to maintain the problematic alignment. The board must address these concerns in response to judicial directives."
